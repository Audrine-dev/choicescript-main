[b]Chapter 7 - The One Who Wears Me[/b]

You wake as if breaking the surface of a dark lake.

Your bed is too still. The silence — too complete. Even your heartbeat seems hesitant, muffled under layers of something heavy and unseen.

The room breathes differently. You can feel it before your eyes even open — a hum behind the silence, as if the walls are whispering. 
Your breath fogs the air, though no cold touches your skin. Everything smells faintly of [i]ash and rosewater[/i].

Your room is the same.
[i]Almost.[/i]

And then you see it.

A mirror stands where there was none before — tall, thin, wrong in its proportions. It leans slightly inward, like it’s listening. 
Its surface is cloudy, like breath against glass. Not reflecting the room. Not yet.
The mirror isn’t supposed to be there.

It stands against the far wall, tall and lean, [i]a frame of blackened silver[/i], veined like bone. 
The glass looks like liquid smoke, barely holding its surface. You don’t remember owning such a thing. 
You don’t remember [i]this room[/i] ever having shadows that shift on their own.

The light is dim, but not in the way morning light should be.
It’s grey, silvery, as though poured through frozen glass. Nothing moves.
*page_break Your eyes adjust slowly

You blink.

In the mirror, someone shifts.

You sit up slowly.
So do they.

Your skin prickles. You rise — so does the figure. Your breath catches.
Because it's you.
But not.

Your reflection’s eyes are slightly too wide, too dark. There’s a sheen to the skin, not sweat—something cooler. 
Its movements are slow, precise, like it's deliberately mimicking yours.

Not natural reflection.

[i]Performance.[/i]

And then —
*page_break It smiles. 

Just a little.

Your mouth does [i]not[/i].

Your throat goes tight. You edge toward the mirror, drawn and afraid, one foot after the other on chilled wood. 
The air presses in, humming faintly, like it’s holding its breath with you.

You stop two paces away.

The mirror blinks.

Your stomach drops.

Behind you, your familiar growls low — not fearfully, but uncertainly, a sound made when instincts can’t agree.

Then — the reflection speaks.

The voice is yours, but buried under velvet. Yours — and [i]hers[/i].

[i]“The crossing has already begun.”[/i]

The mirror clouds again. Frost veils the glass in delicate, branching patterns. Your double vanishes like breath into winter air.

Silence.

And just beneath it, a sound like distant water… or something pulling itself up from beneath it.
*page_break Next

You rise, drawn by some unseen tide. The familiar is gone, or sleeping, or silenced. Even your breath sounds far away.

You look in the mirror.

And it looks back.

But [i]not you.[/i] Not anymore.

Her smile blooms like blood across still water.

She [i]wears your face[/i], but it's softer, older — wiser — and wrong. Her eyes aren’t quite yours. 
They shimmer too much, the irises shot through with starlight and [i]black fire[/i]. Her lips part just slightly — not to breathe, but to taste.

She tilts her head — perfectly matched to yours — until you realize [i]you haven’t moved at all.[/i]

Then she steps forward.

But the glass doesn't break.

[i]She steps through it.[/i]

Or no — you blink, and she's [i]on your side[/i] of the world. But still in the mirror. A smear of unreality. 
Her body flickers at the edges like a flame starved of oxygen.

When she speaks, [i]your bones remember the sound[/i] before your ears do.

“It’s begun,” she whispers, and her voice carries all the weight of forgotten prayers.

“The crossing is awake. And I…,” she smiles, teeth a shade too white to be human.

“I am not the only one watching now.”

You try to speak. You try to move. But your limbs feel submerged, as if reality itself thickened.
*page_break Next

Her head tilts further — until the angle becomes [i]wrong[/i], insect-like. Her fingers twitch — too many joints, not enough time between movements.

Then she speaks again. And this time, the voice splits — hers and yours — layered, disharmonious.

“You’ll wear me soon enough.”
*page_break But the reflection is no longer yours.

It stares with your eyes — not empty now, but ancient.
Pale lashes, pale face, the curve of your mouth softened into something knowing.
Something unbearably sad.

She doesn’t move her lips when she speaks.

The air hums like breath caught in a throat. The mirror holds more than image—it holds memory. Hunger. Truth wrapped in beauty.

The figure its head — a little too slowly, like joints adjusting in a dream. 
Her eyes are deeper than yours. Her voice, when it comes, is velvet and glass.

“The crossing begins.”

“And with it… the return.”

The world around you bends in slow spirals of shadow and color, like wet ink bleeding through parchment.

Somewhere beyond the fog, a voice continues.

Not spoken — [i]remembered[/i]. Like a song you forgot you knew.

[i]“Do you know how the sky broke?”[/i]

Her voice is a bell in a cathedral drowned beneath the sea.
*page_break “Once, there were three of us.”

[i]“Once, the heavens burned with unity. Sisters, born of love and law, danced across the firmament. 
Together, they built the weave that holds the world — magic, truth, time. Harmony.”[/i]

A ripple crosses the mirror. Her face fractures, just for a moment. You glimpse a shadow behind her — a third figure, laughing. 
Eyes of moonlit silver with underlying hues of indigo.

“But what is light, if not the lure for shadow?”

“And what is love, if not the [i]wound[/i] the shadow finds?”

She raises a hand — your hand — and the water parts like pages in a book.
Behind her in the mirror, a world appears — unfamiliar, yet aching with recognition. A battlefield of stars. 
Cities carved into the bones of giants. A sea made of silver fire, curling like veins through the void.

“Long ago,” she murmurs, “there was peace—brief, bright, [i]doomed[/i].”

The mirror’s surface ripples like disturbed water.

The fog parts like hands and you stand on a bridge that was never built.. It stretches across nothing, stitched from light and bone, 
spiraling into a void too vast to name.
*page_break Next

Below a war made of gods. [i]The Sundering of the Sky.[/i] And you see [i]a battlefield[/i], frozen in silver ash. 
Mountains cracked in half, skies veined with molten light. 
Bodies — gods and mortals — burned into the earth like shadows scorched into stone.

Not soldiers. Not men. [i]Ideas[/i], clothed in fire and sorrow and the shattering of stars.

A woman moves ahead of you—robes trailing stardust and ink, eyes like a dying sun. She is beauty honed into blade. Not gentle. Not cruel. Simply [i]inevitable[/i].

She lifts her hand.

“Truth,” she says. And her voice slices open the sky.

Another follows—arms bare, gold tattooed like branches across her skin. Her hair burns blue, her gaze is pain wrapped in grace. She does not speak.

She sings.

[i]Magic[/i] erupts in waves. Colors you cannot name. Chords of power, spun from what-might-have-been.

The two stand together—sisters not by blood, but by purpose.
*page_break And then...

He arrives not like a man, but like [i]a crack[/i] in the world. Like the moment a mirror decides it’s had enough.

He is beautiful. He is [i]horrifying[/i].

He wears a smile like a blade, and his eyes carry no mercy—only hunger. A hunger that thinks it is [i]love[/i].

He steps onto the bridge of light, and it [i]weeps[/i] beneath his feet.

“Why do you fear me?” he asks. “You [i]made[/i] me.”

The first woman lifts her sword of words.

The second closes her eyes and becomes a storm.

They fight—not in motion, but in collapse. Language breaks. Time forgets how to breathe.

You see towers fall. Oceans climb into the sky and freeze there, reaching.

You see [i]a child’s face[/i], lit with fire, screaming without sound.

You see a name carved into the bones of creation, only for it to be [i]scrubbed out by blood.[/i]

The two goddesses strike as one—and [i]bind him[/i].

Not destroy. 
*page_break They couldn’t

But they tear open the place between places and push him [i]into the wound[/i].

They fall with him.

And then…

Only silence.

The reflection flickers.

Not because the water moves — but because [i]you[/i] do.
Or rather, the thing wearing your shape.

It smiles again — her smile.
Your smile.
But stretched too wide now. Fragile at the corners. Like skin sewn over something else.

“They said it was light against shadow. But there is no such purity. There never was.”

The dream around you begins to [i]thin[/i], like breath fog on glass. 
The stars above flicker — not like light, but like [i]holes punched through paper[/i]. Something stirs behind them.

“We unmade him. We—”
She falters. For the first time, her voice cracks.
“We [i]chose[/i] to unmake him.”

You don’t understand. Not yet. But your chest tightens, and your hands feel too light.
As though part of you is already [i]missing[/i].
*page_break Then she begins to explain

“Three daughters walked the heavens. One with will. One with truth. One with... nothing at all, and yet everything inside her.”

The third daughter’s image does not form. Only a shiver in the mirror.

“We stood against what should never have lived. It wore no name, only desire. It unmade without meaning.”

Three figures stand at the edge of the abyss. One cloaked in silver fire, another with a blade of pure light. And the third...

[i]Unseen.[/i]

[i]Unspoken[/i]

The mirror shimmers behind her, silver bruised with shadow. The reflection is not quite your own — her eyes too deep, too sad, too knowing. 

You feel it before you understand it.

Like an ember rekindled in ash.

The figure before you — silver-lit and veiled in mist — has never said her name. 
But now, as the mirror stills and your own reflection fades into her shape again, something slips through the veil.

A sound — or a memory — no, a knowing.

Not spoken aloud.

Not learned.

But remembered.

Like a spell already inside you.
*page_break [i]A name.[/i]

It presses against your chest like a heartbeat that isn’t yours.

A name burned into the bones of the world.
A name hidden in the old blood.
A name stitched through your soul like a buried thread finally tugged free.

[b]Venora[/b].

The name rises behind your ribs like breath, like fire, like fate.

And she does not correct you when you whisper it.

Her eyes shimmer once, not in surprise, but in sorrow.

“He once stood among us...,” she speaks, and her voice folds over you like a forgotten lullaby and the toll of a funeral bell wrapped in one breath.

[i]“He was born from a longing the stars could not hold,”[/i]
she says, fingers tracing the glass, though they do not touch your face.
“Not from love… not exactly. From [i]need[/i]. The kind that aches behind your ribs even when the world offers you everything.”

She turns — slow, weightless, as though gravity forgets her — and her shadow stretches behind her like wings burned down to smoke.

“[i]The One Who Dreamed All[/i] woke alone. She made daughters to fill the sky with wonder, gave them [i]names[/i], gave them [i]power[/i].
But even a god can feel [i]hollow[/i].”

“So she reached into her own reflection. Not a child this time, but a twin. Not life born from breath, but from balance.”

Her voice tightens — “And together, they broke [i]the law of creation[/i].”

You try to speak. You cannot. The mirror hums beneath your skin. The air around you pulses like something breathing.
*page_break Next

“What they made could not be contained. A fire that refused to flicker. A will that knew no patience. A hunger too vast for stars or gods or meaning.”

Her eyes meet yours, and you feel as though a thousand lifetimes have passed between you.

[i]“He was not born in the way we were. Not shaped by story or silence. He unfolded. He awoke. He looked at the laws that bound us and laughed.”[/i]

She draws a line across the air with her hand. It leaves behind a thin, crimson streak—like light through a slit throat in the sky.

“And when the others turned from him—when the one who made him would not look, and the one who mirrored him would not act—he chose to remake the world 
in his own design.”

You see it now in her eyes. Not fear.
[i]Regret.[/i]

“So began the burning. [i]The Sundering of the Sky.[/i] And though we cast him down, [i]gods[/i] do not die as mortals do. He lingers. [i]He waits.[/i]”

A silence, vast and aching. Then—softly:

“And you, child of last flame… You are the only one he will not wait for.”
*page_break Next

The mirror shifts again — not glass, but water now, and beyond its trembling surface you see not your face, but his.

Or the memory of him.

A man with eyes like frozen flame and wildfire gold. A voice you haven’t heard — not truly — 
but already know will say your name like it’s a [i]sin[/i] he plans to commit.

Venora's voice tightens, softens — takes on a strange, terrible weight.

“He once stood among us,” she says, barely more than a breath.
“Not a shadow. Not yet. A god — still becoming.
But even then, we knew.
He looked at creation and did not see wonder.
He saw [i]unfinished work[/i].”

You glimpse it in the shifting glass — temples burning, skies cracking like glass, stars folding inward like dying flowers. 
And in the center of it: that same man.
*page_break Smiling

“He came to me in the final days,” Venora continues.
“Asked me to follow. [i]To unmake.[/i]
To leave behind order, time, breath…
And I said [b]no[/b].”

The word falls heavy. Like a blade drawn slow.

“I stood against him when the others could not.
I fractured him with the old magic —
the first spell, the last flame.
And I watched him [i]fall[/i].”

She touches the surface of the mirror, and her hand ripples into yours — but you do not feel warmth. You feel the echo of pain. Something ancient. [i]Buried[/i].

“That betrayal burned itself into him.
Into what remained of him.”
*page_break Her eyes find yours

They are no longer reflections. They are memories, and they are yours.

“And when you were born, [i]child of mine[/i] — when the last witch drew her first breath — he [i]felt[/i] you.”

You see it then. The boy-god in the ruins. A sudden stillness. A pull across the void. A name not yet spoken. A fire awakening in the dark.

“You are the last piece of the soul that denied him. The echo of my defiance. The spark he cannot kill.”

“And that… [i]terrifies[/i] him.”

The mirror begins to tremble. Shapes flicker behind it — a hand, a mouth, a smirk twisted in longing. And her voice becomes softer now. More intimate. 
A confession wrapped in [i]warning[/i].

“You remind him of everything he lost.
You tempt him with [i]what he could be[/i] again.
And still — you resist him.”

The world darkens. The mirror glows brighter.

“He now leads the witch hunts because of you. He scours magic from the world to quiet [i]the flame[/i] inside him — the one that whispers your name.
But now?”
She leans closer. “You walk freely. And he can’t look away.”

And then — the voice changes.

Not hers.
*page_break [i]His.[/i]

Low. Velvet-wrapped sin. Like a memory you’re about to make.
It slides in behind hers, like another echo in the same hallway.

“They always tell it that way, don’t they? [i]The traitor.[/i] The fire. The fall.”

You turn.

But there’s no one there.

And then, [i]he[/i] is.

Emerging like smoke through glass. Not stepping — [i]appearing[/i]. Effortless. Familiar.

Too familiar.

He has your eyes, almost. Your mouth, twisted in a soft, knowing smirk.
But the shape of him is wrong. Too sharp in places. Too soft in others.

And beautiful. Terribly beautiful.

“You don’t remember the warmth, do you? Just the burn.”

His eyes are molten gold caught in frost — and they [i]see[/i] you.

“She’ll never tell you what you are. Not really. She’s afraid you’ll like it.”

He steps forward. You can’t move. You’re not paralyzed — you simply [i]won’t[/i]. Not while he’s looking at you like [i]that[/i].

“You’re not hers.”
*page_break “Not anymore.”

Venora—if it’s still her—flickers at the edge of your vision, blurred now, as though the dream itself is [i]rejecting[/i] her.

“Do not listen—” she tries to say.

But he interrupts.

“They're the ones who made me. And she lied to you the moment you were born.”

He raises his hand — not touching, not yet — and the air around your skin warms. Sweet, intoxicating. [i]Amber. Smoke. Leather.[/i]

“Come find me when the sky bleeds gold.”

His voice crawls down your spine.

“I’ll show you what you’re really made of.”

You don’t speak.
Not yet.
Because something in you is listening.

Something beneath the waking self — beneath even memory.

His words are a blade and a balm, honey-laced with venom, and still…
Still, part of you leans in.

And now—the moment holds its breath, waiting.

[i]What do you do?[/i]
*choice
	#"You’re wrong. I don’t belong to anyone."
		You step forward. Not away from him—but between them.

		Between her blurred light and his velvet dark. Between names and futures that neither you nor the stars have chosen yet.

		Your voice is quiet. But solid.

		“I’m not hers. But I’m not yours either.”

		The words echo through the dream like a dropped stone into still water—rippling across the air, across the mirrored ground beneath your feet.

		And something in him stills.

		He doesn’t frown. Doesn’t rage.
		He [i]smiles[/i].

		But it’s different now—lower in the face, more private. A look a storm gives the mountain that refuses to bend.

		“A little spark of will,” he says softly. “How [i]quaint[/i].”

		“How [i]dangerous[/i].”

		He steps closer again, but you don’t move.

		“You think you’re choosing neutrality. But there is no such thing where gods are involved.”

		The dream’s edges fray around you—curling like burned parchment.
		Venora—if that’s still what she is—flickers like a dying candle in your periphery, no longer reaching for you. Watching. Weighing.

		“They’ll all come for you,” he whispers. “Every last remnant of what once ruled this broken sky.”

		“They’ll say it’s destiny. Or balance. Or love.”

		“But none of them will ask what [i]you[/i] want. Not really.”

		He doesn’t try to touch you again. Not now.
		Instead, he looks you in the eye—and bows his head, just slightly.

		A gesture not of surrender. But of recognition.

		“When you’re ready to burn everything down, 
		*if (female)
			little witch,” he says, “you’ll know where to find me.”
		*if (male)
			little witcher,” he says, “you’ll know where to find me.”
		*if (el_pr)
			little witchling,” he says, “you’ll know where to find me.”

		Then he vanishes like smoke drawn into the wind.
		And the dream begins to collapse.
		*set draegan_rel +30
		*goto draegan_gone
	
	#"Tell me, then. Tell me what I am."
		The question slips from your lips like something forbidden—soft, breathless, aching with need.

		“If she lied… if they all lied… then tell me. Tell me [i]what I am[/i].”

		He doesn't smile. Not exactly. But his gaze sharpens—hungry, almost [i]reverent[/i]. As if you’ve just said the only words that ever mattered.

		“Ah,” he murmurs. “So you’ve felt it, too. The ache beneath the fire.”

		A single step, and the space between you folds like silk. The air simmers, humming with heat and memory. This time, you don’t pull back. You [i]lean in[/i].

		“Good,” he whispers.
		“Then you’re ready to stop pretending you were ever meant to be theirs.”

		His voice is low, seductive, curling through you like smoke through cracks.

		“You weren’t born. Not entirely like they are. You were made—shaped in the dying light of gods. 
		Forged in the silence between their last breath and her final scream.”

		You shudder, not from fear—but recognition.

		His hand doesn’t touch you. It [i]hovers[/i].
		And in that unbearable space between skin and skin, something flares.

		“You are what remains when faith burns away… When power forgets its name and claws through ash, looking for a shape to wear.”

		The heat presses into your bones—too much, too close, [i]too right[/i].

		“She poured herself into you. Drop by drop. Thought you’d carry her hope.”
		
		[i]A pause.[/i]
		
		“But magic… magic remembers its source.”

		Your pulse stutters.
		You can feel it—coiled inside you.
		A hunger not yours. Or maybe too much yours.

		[i]“That ache in your belly when the sky bleeds red?”[/i]
		
		[i]“That pull in your chest when someone whispers your name in the dark?”[/i]
		
		[i]“That’s not hers.”[/i]

		His eyes catch yours, molten gold caught in frost. Drowning and divine.

		“That’s mine.”

		You don’t breathe. You can’t.
		The silence between you is charged, trembling, ripe with unspoken things.

		[i]A promise.[/i]
		[i]A warning.[/i]
		[i]A vow you don’t remember making.[/i]

		“Come find me,
		*if (female)
			little witch,” he says, voice like velvet dragging across your throat, “when the sky bleeds gold. And I’ll show you what you’re really made of.”
		*if (male)
			little witcher,” he says, voice like velvet dragging across your throat, “when the sky bleeds gold. And I’ll show you what you’re really made of.”
		*if (el_pr)
			little witchling,” he says, voice like velvet dragging across your throat, “when the sky bleeds gold. And I’ll show you what you’re really made of.”

		And just like that—he's gone.
		Smoke in the mirror. A kiss you almost remember.

		You’re left trembling.
		Heart racing.
		Mouth dry with questions that taste like sins.

		And somewhere, deep inside your chest, something starts [i]to burn[/i].
		*set draegan_rel +50
		*goto draegan_gone
	
	#"Get out of my head."
		The air thickens. You can’t breathe.

		And it’s not fear—not entirely.

		It’s the feeling of standing too close to a cliff in a dream, knowing you’ll fall not because you were pushed, 
		but because some part of you wants to see what’s at the bottom.

		But you can’t let it happen. You won’t.

		“Get out,” you snarl. “Get out of my head.”

		He stops.

		Not because he’s surprised. But because he wants you to see what you’ve just revealed.

		He smiles. Pitying. Beautiful. Terrifying.

		“You think this is your mind?” he asks softly. “That this dream belongs to you?”

		“You don’t understand.”

		He raises a hand—and the world around you shudders, frays at the edges. The sky splinters with cracks of bleeding light.

		“You were born in someone else’s lie. You’ve never been alone in here.”

		You turn to Venora—if that’s who she truly is—but she’s fading again.
		Her shape flickers. Her mouth moves. No sound.

		And then he’s closer again, filling the silence she left behind.

		“I am the thought at the back of your mind. The warmth you never asked for. The shadow in your mirror.”

		His voice tightens like silk drawn through your ribs.

		“You can push me away all you like. I’ll always be there, 
		*if (female)
			[i]little witch[/i],” he murmurs. 
		*if (male)
			[i]little witcher[/i],” he murmurs. 
		*if (el_pr)
			[i]little witchling[/i],” he murmurs. 

		“Even if I die. Even if you kill me.”

		“Because some part of you was made from the ruin of me.”

		He doesn’t wait for your reply.

		The dream implodes around you like wet glass.
		*set willpower +1
		*goto draegan_gone
	
	#Say Nothing
		You don't speak.
		Don't flinch.
		Don't run.

		You do nothing—except stay.

		Let it happen. Let it unfold. Let it breathe through you.

		His smile changes. Grows quieter. Not mocking now. Not triumphant.

		Almost… reverent.

		“Yes,” he whispers. “That’s it.”

		He moves like smoke, but doesn’t close the distance this time.

		“You were always meant to remember this in silence.”

		You feel it now — the hum under your ribs. The ache behind your heart. Like a song you’ve always known but never sung.

		“Let them name you,” he says. “Let them pull you toward their stories. You don’t need to choose.”

		“Not yet.”

		A breath. A heartbeat. A spark in the dark.

		“Because I already did.”

		The sky begins to bleed. Crimson. The stars unravel.
		And as the dream dissolves into brilliance—

		You know you will meet him again.

		You must.
		*goto draegan_gone

*label draegan_gone

The warmth still lingers where he stood.

And far away, [i]a bell is tolling[/i], though no one hears it but you.
*page_break Next

You drift, if drifting is even the right word for this.

There’s no gravity here. No edge. Only questions shaped like wounds. And echoes wearing voices like borrowed skin.

You are thinking—but not with thought. You are feeling your way through meaning. Following the heat he left behind.

The voice still lingers—not a sound now, but a pressure against your ribs. A second heartbeat.

“You’re not hers anymore.”

Not hers. Not his.

Then whose?

[i]Yours?[/i]

But if you were made, [i]not born...[/i]
If you carry pieces of gods sewn into the hollows of your being—[i]Are you anything at all?[/i]

Or just an echo pretending to be whole?

You remember the way he looked at you. Like you were both prey and mirror. Like you were something he [i]lost[/i]… or something he wanted to become.

And the worst part?

You felt it too.

That heat in your spine wasn’t just magic.

It was [i]recognition[/i].

Something inside you leaned toward him, not in fear, not even desire—but kinship.

Like calling to like. Flame to flame.
*page_break But he said she lied

He said they did.

And if gods can lie, if creation itself can be betrayal—then what is truth?

Is it blood?

Memory?

Pain?

Or is it the shape you choose to carve out of the wreckage?

A shape no god predicted.

A future no fate dared to write.

[i]“I am not a vessel,”[/i] you whisper to the dark.

“I am the hand that holds it.”

And just like that, the dream begins to bend. Light trembles along the edges. The vision begins to break.

But before it does, a final whisper—his, almost too soft to hear:

“You’ll call me what they fear to name. And when you do, it will already be too late.”
*page_break Next

You wake gasping. Not like drowning.
Like burning.

Like the air in your lungs is too thick with [i]smoke[/i] to breathe — but you still try.

The world is wrong. Tilted.
Your body knows it before your thoughts catch up. Before your name returns to you.
If it ever does.

You’re lying in the dark.
But the dark isn’t still. It hums. It coils.

The sheets beneath you are damp — sweat, maybe, or blood — you can’t be sure. The air is warm with a scent that doesn’t belong here: [i]amber, leather, smoke[/i].

You sit up. [i]Slowly.[/i] As if waking might crack you open.

Your chest aches where he looked at you.
Your mouth still tastes of words you didn’t say.

Something curls in the pit of you — something hungry, something echoing.
It doesn’t feel like fear.
It feels like… [i]gravity[/i].
*page_break Next

You glance toward the mirror.
Just a mirror.

But for a moment, just one, the reflection doesn’t move when you do.

And your eyes—
They look like yours.
But they don’t.

They look like [i]his[/i].

You blink. And it’s gone.

The stillness that follows feels artificial. Like a silence arranged just to test you.
Like the gods — if there are any left — are watching to see if you’ll scream.

[i]You don’t.[/i]

But your hands tremble when you try to stand.
Your legs don’t remember the floor.
You feel split, displaced — you… but not only you.

And then, like the final toll of a bell still ringing in your bones:

[i]“Come find me when the sky bleeds gold.”[/i]

It slithers through your memory, too vivid to be a dream.

You whisper, [i]“What am I?”[/i]

But the walls don't answer.

Just your heartbeat, sounding strange.
Feral. Divine.
Like it doesn’t quite belong to you anymore.
*page_break Next

You sit on the edge of the bed. Not breathing. Not blinking.
The fire still smolders beneath your skin, but the room is too quiet for flames.

Then—
[i]A creak.[/i]
Not of floorboards or wind, but something older. The sound of the world shifting on its axis.

A knock at the door.

Not harsh. Not loud.
But it strikes you like thunder anyway.

“${name}?”

The voice muffled, tentative. [i]Familiar.[/i]

You're still not fully awake.

The dream clings like wet silk, and somewhere in the back of your mind, his voice still echoes:

[i]"You bear her flame like it’s yours…"[/i]

The dream hasn’t quite left you.
*page_break Next

Its echo lingers behind your eyes — smoke curling in the hollows of your ribs. 
You’re not sure if your breath is real, or just another memory breathing through you.

Then—

A rustle.

Not of trees or wind.

But fabric. Feet.

The sound of someone trying not to startle you, and failing.

You blink, and the world reassembles around you. [i]The Cradle.[/i] Stone-warmed and moss-veined, it curls like a memory in the dark, 
hidden beneath root and rock and time, the scent of ash and lavender, the gentle hum of wards woven into the walls. 

The fire has burned low, and a pale morning filters in, milk-white and uncertain.

And in the doorway, framed in the hush before stormlight—
*page_break [i]Laemir[/i]

She looks like someone who once belonged to another life.

Hair the color of dusk-struck silver, loosely braided, curls escaping like secrets she never got around to telling. 
A cloak half-thrown over nightclothes, hands dusted in flour and ward-salt. 
There’s a smear of something red at the edge of her sleeve — not blood, you think, but dried berries or pigment from a charm-circle hastily drawn. 
She smells like rosemary and smoke. Like [i]home[/i].

And her eyes—

They are the color of weathered oak bark, lined with sleeplessness, and wide with fear she’s trying very hard to keep hidden.

But it lives in her voice when she speaks your name.

Softly, like a spell she’s too old to cast.

[i]“Sweetling,”[/i] she whispers. “You need to get up. Something’s [i]wrong[/i].”

Your name is a comfort on her lips — but today, even that feels like a farewell. 
Her voice wavers between the shape of a lullaby and the edge of a warning. And the quiet between her words is louder than thunder.

You sit up, breath still tethered to the space where he had just been, where she had spoken in flickers and truths.

Laemir crosses to you in a few steps and [i]kneels[/i] beside your bed, her hand pressing gently to your cheek, checking for fever — or for something else. 
Something [i]older[/i].

Her palm is warm, but shaking.
*page_break Next

“The village… they live in the hushed spaces between breaths, afraid to speak magic’s name aloud. Ashwood trembles beneath its own fear.”

She pauses, and the silence seems to swell, thick with memories too bitter to name.

“The hunts carved through them like a cruel winter, stealing neighbors, friends — [i]tearing[/i] families apart. 
No one knows whom to trust anymore, not even themselves.”

Laemir’s fingers curl around a pendant at her throat — a delicate thing, worn and faded, as if bearing the weight of unspoken prayers.

“They shun the witches. Whispers of curses and doom have spread all over Ashwood. 
Mothers clutch their children tightly when crossing the street. Doors are bolted shut before night falls.”

Her voice trembles — not with fear, but with [i]a sorrow[/i] that presses down like stone.

“[i]The Light of Valtessa[/i] has poisoned more than flesh and bone. It’s a wound in the heart of Ashwood itself.”

She looks to you then, eyes searching, [i]fierce[/i].

“The villagers don’t want witches to walk among them, but neither do they want the fire to come again.”

Her hand rests briefly on your shoulder — warm and steady, an anchor in the rising storm.

“We stand at a crossroads. The cradle offers shelter, but it cannot shield what [i]breaks[/i] beyond its walls. 
Soon, [i]the choice[/i] will be yours: fight the darkness, or vanish before it consumes us all.”

Laemir’s words hang [i]heavy[/i] in the cradle’s still air — a fragile echo against stone and shadow.

You feel the weight of the crossroads pressing down, the pulse of fate throbbing beneath your skin.

What will you do when the choice comes?
*choice
	#You will stand and fight
		[i]“I will not vanish into the shadows, nor bow before the creeping darkness. 
		To yield now is to surrender everything I am, everything I was born to be.”[/i]

		You draw a breath, steady and slow, feeling the ancient power within you [i]pulse[/i] like a wild drumbeat. 
		The memories of fire and betrayal, of gods and broken promises, awaken deep inside. 
		Your hands itch to shape magic, to wield it as both [i]sword[/i] and [i]shield[/i]. 
		You are the last ember of a forgotten flame, the final hope that refuses to be snuffed.

		To stand and fight means to face the world’s cruelty head-on — the whispers of fear, the flash of steel, the weight of lives hanging by a thread. 
		It means embracing pain, sacrifice, and the terrible beauty of resistance. 
		You will gather allies, kindle rebellion, and spark a light that even the deepest darkness [i]cannot/i] swallow. 
		The road will be brutal and lonely, but you will walk it with fire in your eyes and unyielding will in your heart.

	#You will vanish and watch
		[i]“There is wisdom in silence. Strength in invisibility. 
		Sometimes the most powerful warriors are those who slip unseen through the shadows, striking not with brute force but with patience and cunning.”[/i]

		You feel the pull of shadow like a cool cloak, a refuge in the storm. 
		To disappear is not to give up, but to [i]survive[/i] — to breathe in the dark and watch the tide turn. 
		You will become [i]a ghost[/i] among ghosts, a whisper in the wind, moving unseen through the world that hunts you.

		This path demands cold calculation and the sacrifice of presence. 
		It is to hold your power close, to choose the moment of impact with care. 
		You will learn to read the shifting currents of fear and hope, waiting for the fracture in the enemy’s armor. 
		To vanish is to live in the spaces between worlds, unseen yet unbroken. Your patience will be your weapon — quiet, relentless, inevitable.

		[i]“The war is not only fought with blade and spell.

		Your heart aches with questions that twist and turn like roots in dark soil. 
		What if the answers lie not in the battlefield, but in the forgotten histories — the secrets kept by those who trembled before the coming storm? 
		You will become a seeker of shadows, unraveling the tangled threads of myth and memory.

		This journey is one of [i]discovery[/i] and [i]danger[/i] — unearthing forbidden knowledge, confronting truths too heavy for the world to bear. 
		It will lead you to ancient places where magic still lingers in silence, to relics imbued with power and pain. 
		You may find allies in unexpected forms, or betrayals buried deep beneath trust. 
		To seek the lost truth is [i]to challenge fate itself[/i], to rewrite the stories that bind you and the world.

		[i]“If the world will not stop the hunt, then I will become its shield. The last barrier between innocence and the consuming flame.”[/i]

		The threads of magic hum beneath your fingertips — delicate, potent, and alive. 
		You will weave wards like spiderwebs spun from light and shadow, binding protection around those who [i]cannot[/i] fight. 
		Children who do not understand the hatred that hunts them. Elders who whisper prayers to gods long silent. 
		[i]The innocent[/i] caught in the crossfire of a war not their own.

		This path asks for selflessness and resilience, for the courage to bear wounds unseen and to stand when the world wants you to fall. 
		You will become a sanctuary — a cradle of [i]hope[/i] amid the chaos — even if it means burning yourself to embers to keep the flame alive. 
		In your care, magic will not die quietly; it will roar in [i]silent defiance[/i].

Laemir watches you — not with urgency, but with something quieter. Older. [i]A grief[/i] wrapped in patience. 
Like she’s seen this moment before, in firelight or dream, and knew it would come to pass.

You don’t speak. [i]Not yet.[/i]
Because the words would shatter something, and the world already feels cracked too wide.

Instead, you reach for the edge of the hearthstone that is still warm from the dying fire — and let your fingers rest there. Anchor yourself in something real. 
Something [i]here[/i].

Above, the wind howls through the throat of the cradle, a low and mournful thing. The cave breathes around you. 
Stone weeps where it once held sunlight. Shadows cling to the corners like secrets.
The warding hums faintly, the runes in the rock [i]pulsing[/i] like the echo of a fading heartbeat.
*page_break Next

“I saw it,” you say at last, and your voice feels like it doesn't belong to you. “[i]The Light of Valtessa[/i]. In the village. They [i]took[/i] Tomas.”

His name sticks in your mouth, [i]raw[/i]. Like a loose tooth, you can’t stop touching.

Laemir closes her eyes. Her shoulders sink beneath the furred shawl she wears — not with defeat, but with [i]knowing[/i]. With history.

“I know,” she murmurs. “They’ve been here [i]three days[/i]. Preaching purity and dragging [i]fear[/i] behind them like chains. 
Ashwood’s bones are brittle, and they came [i]to break[/i] what’s left.”

She pauses, then adds, softer, “And they may come for you next.”

The cradle of your chest tightens.

You knew. Of course, you knew. The minute Tomas screamed. The minute the sky above the village cracked open with light. 
The minute you felt the magic recoil inside you like a struck bell.

*if (angered_soldier)
	You shift your weight, the stone beneath you cool and damp, shaped by centuries of silence. Laemir speaks, but her voice is distant — blurred by memory, by the echo of something sharper. A palm across your cheek. Holy rings. The taste of iron and incense. The Light’s blessing, they’d called it. A lesson in humility, dressed in gold. You didn’t bow then. [i]You don't now[/i]. “Next time,” Laemir says quietly, not unkindly, “speak the fire with your mouth [i]closed[i].”

Still, hearing her say it settles the truth into your marrow.

“They said he [i]confessed[/i],” you whisper.

Laemir snorts — a small, bitter sound. “Confessed, or begged for [i]mercy[/i]?”
*page_break The silence curls between you again

When she looks at you again, her eyes gleam with something fierce and fragile.

“I let you stay here for as long as I could,” she says. “I cared for this place so the world couldn’t touch you. But the world has found you anyway.”

You nod. Not because you agree — but because there’s nothing left to disagree with.

And because you feel it now, under your skin.

[i]The pull.[/i]

[i]The unraveling.[/i]

[i]The beginning.[/i]

Outside, the wind shifts. The wards flare, subtle but sharp.

Something just crossed the boundary.

Laemir’s gaze cuts toward the tunnel’s mouth, her lips parting.

You don’t have time to ask. Don’t need to.

Because then—
*page_break The knock

Three times.

Deliberate.

Measured.

[i]Wrong.[/i]

Laemir rises in a blur, already reaching for the old blade hidden beneath the hanging herbs.

Your pulse races. Magic flickers at your fingertips, wild and waiting.

Something has found the Cradle.

Or [i]someone[/i].
*page_break Next

A sound. Not the knock.

[i]The sound of someone hitting the ground.[/i]
A body, striking the stone just beyond the threshold.

Laemir moves first. Her steps are swift, near silent. The wards peel back like threads drawn from silk. You follow, breath caught in your throat.

The tunnel’s edge opens to the lightless mouth of morning. Grey mist clings to the stones like old breath. 
And there, [i]crumpled[/i] at the line where magic ends and shadow begins—

Tomas’s sister. [i]Alin.[/i]

You know her by the braid that’s half-undone, by the threadbare shawl still stained with woodsmoke.
Blood paints her temple. One shoe is missing. She looks impossibly [i]small[/i].

[i]“Laemir,”[/i] you whisper.

But she’s already kneeling.

“She ran,” Alin rasps, not looking at you. Her eyes lock on Laemir’s like a lifeline.

“He screamed for you. They— they burned his books. They said he was a vessel.
They’ll do worse at dawn—
They said the sun and the truth would [i]cleanse[/i] him.”
*page_break Next

Laemir presses her hand gently to the girl’s chest — not with power, but with practiced care. 
Her fingers move with the steadiness of someone who has set too many bones and [i]buried[/i] too many names. 
She checks the pulse, the breath, the heat beneath the skin.

No glow. No shimmer. Just touch. Just [i]human[/i].

She tears a strip from her sleeve with one swift motion and begins to wrap the girl’s temple, the cloth [i]blooming dark[/i] with blood.

“She’s [i]cold[/i],” Laemir murmurs, more to herself than you. Her voice is low. Steady. 
But her eyes never stop searching the Alin’s face — as if willing her to stay.

*label Alin_question
“Keep her [i]talking[/i],” she says, without looking up. “If she sleeps, she might not wake.”

		The question leaves you hollow.

		It isn’t curiosity — it’s ache.
		A weight behind your ribs, already knowing the shape of the answer.

		Her fingers are pale where they grip the blanket. Her mouth pulls tight, like something unsaid is pressing to get out.

		[i]“I saw them take him.”[/i]

		Her voice is hoarse, but steady.

		“Tomas. In the square. Broad daylight, like it was [i]justice[/i].”

		The memory flashes behind your eyes — the gleam of holy steel, the bone-white masks. 
		The way the village watched, frozen and silent, as if terror had stolen their tongues.
		
		*if (angered_soldier)
			You remember the heat rising in your throat. The words you flung like [i]fire[/i]. The hand that struck you for it. 

		“They called him tainted. Said the Goddess wept to see her light [i]defiled[/i].”

		She exhales, and something cracks under the breath.
		
		Her eyes stay low, fixed somewhere in the past — her voice scraped thin from too many held-back things.

		“It wasn’t for what he did,” she says. “Not really.”

		She swallows.

		“It was for who he helped.”

		You stay still, breath barely moving.

		“A traveler came through Ashwood a few nights before,” she says. 
		“Barefoot, half-starved, burned across the hands. The kind of person no one wanted to see. The kind that makes people look [i]away[/i].”

		Her jaw tenses.

		[i]“But Tomas didn’t.”[/i]
		*page_break

		“He took them in. Quietly. Didn’t ask for coin. Didn’t ask for a name.”

		Her voice grows tight with memory.

		“I [i]warned[/i] him. Said the wrong stranger could mean trouble. Said the Church was watching.”

		“But he just looked at me. Smiled that soft way of his and said, [i]‘If it were me walking in from the cold, I’d want someone to do the same.’[/i]”

		A silence blooms between you. It stretches wide and raw.

		“They came five days later.”

		“Not for the traveler. They were gone. Just ashprints in the woods. But someone must’ve told. Someone [i]always[/i] tells.”

		She grips the blanket like it might anchor her to the present.

		“They dragged him away. Called it harboring a heretic. [i]‘Aiding the damned.’[/i]”

		“They made him kneel in the square.”

		“They said they were sparing him. That a quiet cell was mercy compared to the pyre.”

		[i]“And then they turned on me.”[i]

		Her voice falters. The next words feel jagged — like they hurt coming out.

		“I tried to stop them.”

		“I shouted. Told them the traveler was a child. That Tomas did [i]nothing[/i] wrong. That mercy wasn’t a crime.”

		“And maybe that was the mistake.”

		“They waited until the crowd cleared. Then came back for me.”

		You can feel it now — the way her body has been carrying this story like a wound that refused to close. 
		Bruises hidden by silence. A heart stitched together by sheer will.
		*page_break Next

		“They said it was just a warning. [i]‘A light touch from Valtessa’s hand.’[/i]”

		“But they hit like gods.”

		A beat.

		“One of the royal scouts turned his eyes away. I think he wanted to speak. But [i]wanting’s[/i] not the same as doing.”

		Her voice lowers, barely more than breath.

		“So I ran.”

		“I didn’t know where else to go. But I remembered [i]Morwenna[/i]. 
		I remembered her stories. About a place deep in the wood. A cradle that wasn’t made for children — but for secrets.”

		“And then I found it.”

		“Found [i]you[/i].”

		You watch her face, searching for the shadows that might still cling there.

		Alin breathes out slowly, eyes [i]clouded[/i] with memories she tries to keep at bay.

		“The cell was narrow — a hollow carved from stone and silence. Its walls soaked in centuries of despair and forgotten prayers. 
		No sun, only flickering torchlight casting ghosts that whispered of fear.”

		“Their presence was a constant shadow—soldiers in bone masks, their faces unreadable, their eyes empty hollows that seemed to [i]swallow[/i] hope whole.”

		“They spoke little but meant everything with every glance, every scrape of iron on stone.”

		“The cold crept under my skin, but the coldest thing was the waiting — waiting for their judgment, their accusations, their [i]cruelty[/i].”

		She pauses, voice trembling like a fragile flame fighting against a night storm.

		“I think... they thought I [i]knew[/i] something,” she murmurs. “About Morwenna. About the old days. They asked about visitors. 
		About who still walks the old paths.”

		She shifts, wincing, a hand drifting instinctively toward her ribs before falling away again.

		“But they didn’t care if I answered. Not really.”

		A breath. Barely audible.

		“They weren’t looking for [i]truth[/i]. They were looking for permission.”

		Her eyes find yours again — and for a heartbeat, you see the grief behind them. Deeper than the bruises. Sharper than the fear.

		Your eyes narrow. Not in anger. In ache.

		[i]“So how did you?”[/i]

		Alin shifts where she sits, the firelight catching on her lashes, her shoulders. Still bruised. Still [i]trembling[/i] in ways she doesn’t let you see.
		But you notice anyway.

		She doesn’t speak right away. Her fingers trace the edge of the woven blanket around her, as though memory might be stitched into the seams.

		“Your mother,” she says quietly. [i]“Morwenna.”[/i]

		A pause. You feel her watching you, measuring whether the name will hurt.

		“We were friends. Once. Before everything. Before the world went quiet with fear.”

		Her voice trembles — [i]not from cold[/i].

		“When the whispers of blood and magic began, she vanished. The village said she’d been killed. Or killed. But I never believed that.”

		“I remembered the way she walked into storms like they [i]owed[/i] her something. The way she smiled like she knew the sky’s secrets. 
		She wasn’t the sort to die quietly.”

		A breath. Deeper now. [i]Sharper.[/i]

		“She told me, once, about a place made of stone and silence. A place where fire couldn’t reach. She never said the name — but she didn’t have to.”

		“When they came for me, when I escaped... I remembered her eyes when she said, [i]‘If the world turns, go where it can’t follow.’[/i]”

		Her voice softens, but it doesn’t break.

		“So I followed the river. I followed memory. And somehow… I ended up here.”

		She looks at you now — not as the frightened girl from Ashwood, but someone else. 
		Someone who’s bled too much to be called lucky. Someone who’s [i]survived[/i] anyway.

		“I didn’t know if you’d be here. But I hoped.”

		“I hoped the blood in your veins still carried her flame.”

		“I didn’t,” she says. “Not really.”

		Her hand tightens around the threadbare blanket. Her voice is quieter now, as though speaking too loud might summon the ghosts she left behind.

		“They brought me to the chapel. Below it — where the stone smells like blood, and the prayers never reach.”

		A pause.

		“I don’t know how long I was there. Hours. [i]Days.[/i] Maybe longer.”

[i]“Alin—?”[/i]

She gasps once, sharp as broken glass, and then begins to seize.

Laemir is already moving. She doesn’t shout, doesn’t panic — just catches her as she falls and lowers her to the stone with practiced hands.

But her face is pale.

“This wasn’t from the wounds,” she breathes. “There’s something inside her. Some curse. Or tether. It’s unraveling now.”

The wards around the Cradle shimmer, catching the surge of magic.

“It’s hooked to her bones,” Laemir says grimly. “They didn’t just hurt her. They [i]marked[/i] her.”

Alin spasms again.

Blood freckles her lips.

Laemir turns to you then — not as your [i]mother[/i], not even as your guardian — but as someone who cannot go where you must.

“You have to go in.”

“Whatever they planted… it’s some kind of magic. And it’s [i]burning through her[/i] like wildfire.”

		Your blood learns hers.

		You see flashes: a cold cell, masked faces, prayers sharpened into knives.

		You don’t flinch, although you can [i]feel[/i] it.

		The spell spirals outward, curling around her ribs, threading through the places where pain has made its home. 
		You give it form — a whisper, a vow, a shield.

		Your blood hums with it: Shaevren, [i]Shaevren[/i], [b]Shaevren![/b] In sacred contexts, [i]Shaevren[/i] doesn’t just mean "live" — it’s closer to 
		[i]“to live as intended by Venora”[/i], with spiritual alignment. And you can feel it. Venora's will flowing through you. Saving. Healing. [i]Taking.[/i]

		And Alin shudders. Her eyes flutter open — just a second, just enough.

		[i]Enough to anchor her back.[/i]

Alin sags against the stone, her breathing less ragged now, but her eyes still shadowed.
The heat — or the cold — of your magic lingers between you.
Your hands ache.
The Cradle feels smaller than it did a moment ago, its walls too close, the air too still.

Laemir crouches beside Alin, checking her pulse with a tenderness that doesn’t reach her eyes.
Her gaze flicks to you — sharp, measuring — before returning to her patient.

“It’ll hold,” Laemir says at last. 
*page_break “For now.”

The “for now” settles into your bones like ice.

Alin swallows hard. Her lips are pale, cracked.
“They… they’re not done. Ashwood’s not the end.”

Her gaze finds yours, fever-bright.

“They spoke of [i]a list[/i]. Names. Places. They’ve barely started.”

Laemir’s jaw tightens, a flicker of something hard passing through her expression.

“Lists,” she mutters. “Always the lists. And always someone willing to write them.”
The words hang in the air like smoke — too heavy to breathe through.

Somewhere beyond the wards, the forest shifts.
A branch snaps.
Too far for danger.
[i]For now.[/i]
*page_break [i]??? - POV[/i]

Eyes trace the edges of Ashwood, sharp and still as dusk begins to bleed into the forest. 
The village holds its breath beneath a shroud of silence, broken only by the distant clatter of hooves and the faint scrape of leather on dirt. 
[i]The Light of Valtessa[/i] moves like a shadow across the land—[i]merciless[/i], unyielding, a blade poised to cut deeper than before.

From the thick branches, fingers curl around rough bark, every muscle coiled and ready. 
The air tastes heavy—thick with fear, with something older and darker twisting beneath the surface. 
Ashwood’s people have folded into themselves, their eyes [i]hollow[/i] where hope used to live.

A ghost of memory flickers behind ${elden_pronpp} gaze—long nights spent in silence, the weight of promises made and broken. 
${elden_big_pronpp} hands have steadied more than one shaking soul, but the ache of what’s lost never leaves. 
It means carrying a burden unseen, standing guard when the world [i]forgets to protect[/i].

A sudden flicker—something raw and unbidden—ripples through the air. Magic, unfamiliar and jagged, 
brushing against the edges of ${elden_pronpp} senses like a warning. Breath catches, quiet but fierce. 
The Cradle holds, for now, but the cracks beneath the surface stretch thin by what’s coming.

A glance toward the hidden cave, a sanctuary born from shadows and whispered [i]hope[/i]. It is a cradle for fragile things—but even cradles can shatter.

The quiet weight of what lies ahead settles like a storm ready to break. 
And there will be someone there—silent, watchful, unwavering—as the world burns and [i]the darkness[/i] reaches for them all.
*page_break Next

${elden_big_pron} watches from the edge of the trees—silent, still, a shadow folded into the gathering dusk. 
${elden_big_pronpp} breath steady, mismatched eyes sharp and unblinking, tracing every flicker of movement in the village below.

There is a weight to ${elden_pronpp} vigil, an unspoken vow that anchors ${elden_pronp} amid the chaos. 
Ashwood trembles beneath the coming storm, but here, in the quiet spaces between heartbeats, ${elden_pron} waits.

Waiting for the moment when silence breaks. When the unseen threads begin to pull taut.

${elden_big_pron} knows the price of waiting. The cost of standing guard when the world forgets to protect.

And yet, ${elden_pron} does not falter.

Not now. [i]Not ever.[/i]

The night deepens. [i]The Light of Valtessa[/i] presses closer.

But so does something else.

Something that moves unseen—like a breath, like a promise.

${elden_big_pron} will be there.

Watching. Waiting.

[i]Steady.[/i]
*page_break Next

The forest hums with voices only ${elden_pron} seems to catch—soft snaps of brittle twigs, the low sigh of ancient pines stirred by a restless wind. 
Each sound presses heavy against ${elden_pronpp} chest, echoing the weight ${elden_pron} carries like a shadow stitched beneath ${elden_pronpp} skin.

Long ago, before nights turned to restless hauntings and the world [i]grew cold[/i] to mercy and magic, ${elden_pron} was different. 
A protector, yes—but not this ghost cloaked in silence, bound by vows that tasted of iron and bitter [i]regret[/i].

The fire lingers in memory—a blaze that swallowed a village, leaving behind nothing but ash and broken bones. 
Faces frozen in terror, betrayal carved into every flicker of flame. The price of arriving too late, of failing to shield the ones ${elden_pron} loved most.

Since then, silence has become ${elden_pronpp} armor, shadows ${elden_pronpp} only refuge. 
Trust is a word ${elden_pron} no longer speaks aloud; loyalty, [i]a chain[/i] wrapped tight around a worn and restless soul.

But beneath the quiet, a storm rages—fierce and unyielding. A promise carved deep: to guard what’s left, to protect those who cannot stand alone.

${elden_big_pron} fears the darkness because ${elden_pron} knows its cutting edge. ${elden_big_pron} moves because stillness means losing ${elden_him} entirely.

So, from the edges of this broken world, ${elden_pron} watches. [i]Waiting.[/i] Steady. 
Bound to a past that will never release ${elden_pronp}, and a future that demands every shred of ${elden_pronpp} strength.
*page_break Next

${elden_big_pron} tucks ${elden_pronpp} calloused hands beneath the rough leather of ${elden_pronpp} cloak, 
the weight of unseen scars pressing against ${elden_pronpp} ribs.
 
The night air tastes sharp, heavy with smoke and silence. Somewhere deep in the forest, a lone owl calls—haunting and distant—like [i]a warning[/i], or a lament.

${elden_big_pronpp} gaze drifts back toward Ashwood, where shadows gather thicker with each passing hour. 
The village holds its breath, trembling beneath the suffocating watch of [i]the Church[/i]. 
[i]The Light of Valtessa[/i] moves like a blade, and ${elden_pron} knows the coming days will demand more than quiet vigilance.

But this night—this quiet before the storm—${elden_pron} allows ${elden_him} one moment of stillness.

Because beneath the stoic mask, beneath the armor forged from loss and duty, beats a heart that aches for [i]more[/i] than survival. 
A heart that remembers what it means to hope, to fight, to stand beside someone [i]worth[/i] protecting.

${elden_big_pron} breathes in the dark, the weight of ${elden_pronpp} past settling like ash on ${elden_pronpp} shoulders. 
And somewhere, in the tangled depths of shadow and silence, ${elden_pron} [i]swears again[/i]: [b]${elden_pron} will not let the darkness claim them all[/b].

Not while ${elden_pron} still draws breath.

A soft wind stirs, carrying whispers through the trees. [i]The hunt[/i] is coming. But so is [i]the reckoning[/i].
*page_break The End... For Now...

[i]That’s all for now.[/i]

The story pauses here, but only for a breath. I'm already deep in the next chapter—unraveling secrets, shaping choices, 
and pulling threads that will take you further into Ashwood and everything it hides.

If something lingered with you—whether a moment, a line, or just the feel of the forest under your skin—I’d love to hear it. 
Your feedback means the world and helps shape where the path leads next!

Thank you for playing.
Thank you for reading.
And thank you for walking with me into the dark.

Until soon.
