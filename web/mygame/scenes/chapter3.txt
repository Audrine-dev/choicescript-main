[b]Chapter 3 - Between Breath and Blood[/b]

The door slams open under your weight.

Your parents freeze, breath caught, eyes widening at the sight of the ${sol_worm} slumped over your shoulder. Blood. Mud. 
Cloak half-dragging on the floor behind you.

“${sol_big_pron}’s hurt,” you breathe, voice hoarse. “I need space. Towels. Boiled water. Now.”

There’s no argument. Just movement. Quick, purposeful, shaken.

You don’t remember crossing the room. Only the feeling of ${sol_pronp} slipping through your arms, ${sol_pronpp} body heavier 
now that the rush of adrenaline is fading. 
You lower ${sol_pronp} gently onto the kitchen table, the warmth of your home almost cruel against ${sol_pronpp} fevered skin.

${sol_big_pronpp} face is pale. So pale.

${sol_big_pron} doesn’t wake.

Your hands shake, but you don’t stop.

The blood has dried in places, clinging like rust to torn fabric and broken skin. 
You wet a cloth in the bowl of water your mother set beside you—steam rising, scent of thyme and iron—and press it gently to the gash along ${sol_pronpp} side.

${sol_big_pron} flinches.

Barely. Just a twitch. But it’s enough to make your heart stutter.

You don’t stop.

You cut away the ruined cloak, the fabric stiff with mud and worse. 
It peels from ${sol_pronpp} skin like it doesn’t want to let go. ${sol_big_pronpp} chest rises shallowly, uneven, 
and a thin line of red seeps from where the jagged edge of ${sol_pronpp} tunic once covered a wound.

The cloth slips from your fingers. You grab another. You don’t look away.

Your father stands near the hearth, hands clenched and brow furrowed like he wants to speak—wants to pull you back, to stop this—but doesn’t. 
He doesn’t understand. Not the sound you followed. Not the pull you felt in your bones.

But your mother kneels beside you.

[i]Quiet. Calm.[/i]
*page_break Next

She doesn’t ask questions. Just rolls up her sleeves and dips her hands into the water. 
She moves like someone who has done this before—not this exact thing, but something close. Something desperate.

“I’ve seen worse,” she says softly, almost like a story meant to distract you as she works. 
“Your uncle once came back from the marsh with half his ribs showing and a frog nesting in his boot.”

You almost laugh. Almost. But the ${sol_worm} on the table groans, and the sound is enough to bring the fear back in full.

“${sol_big_pron}’s burning up,” you whisper, voice tight.

Your mother nods, wringing out a clean cloth and folding it with practiced fingers. “The fever’s already setting in. We’ll need the willow bark. 
And burn salve—real one, not the herb poultice.”

You reach for the small satchel still looped around your shoulder and empty it onto the table. 
Forest remnants spill out—moss, bark, a sprig of something green and bitter.

Your mother looks at you, really looks, and something in her gaze softens.

“You did good,” she murmurs. “${sol_big_pron}’s alive because of you.”

You shake your head, tears stinging the corners of your eyes. “${sol_big_pron}’s barely—”

“But ${sol_pron} is,” she says. “That’s what matters.”

Together, you clean the wounds. Pack them with crushed leaves and careful prayers. She mutters something in the old tongue, fingers moving in quiet rhythm. 
You follow, whispering the words you half-remember from childhood. Just in case.

${sol_big_pronpp} skin is hot beneath your fingers, but ${sol_pron} doesn’t stir again. ${sol_big_pronpp} hair, 
wet and clinging to ${sol_pronpp} face, is gold-tinged even in the low light.

${sol_big_pron} looks like someone out of a story.

The kind that ends in fire. Or prophecy.

You press a damp cloth to ${sol_pronpp} brow. ${sol_big_pron} doesn’t wake. Does not even stir.

And still—you don’t look away.
*page_break

[b]Sol’s POV[/b]

Heat clings to ${sol_pron}. It lives beneath ${sol_pronpp} skin, eats at ${sol_pronpp} breath, curls like smoke in ${sol_pronpp} lungs.

${sol_big_pron} drifts.

Through darkness. Through pain that pulses slow and syrup-thick beneath every bone. There's a voice sometimes—low, familiar. Not calling ${sol_pronp} back. 
[i]Not yet[/i]. Just staying close.

The world doesn’t make sense.

There was the stag. Wasn’t there? Running. The cold bite of the hard ground. Then trees. A fall. And—

[i]Hands[/i].

Not like the ones that would hurt ${sol_pronp}. Not armored with viscous poison. Not cruel.

These are softer. Shaking, but certain. Gentle in the way only someone terrified can be.

${sol_big_pron} tries to speak. ${sol_big_pronpp} lips don’t move. Or maybe they do—maybe ${sol_pron} says something stupid, something about light. 
Or an angel. [i]${sol_big_pronpp}[/i] angel.

${sol_big_pron} can't tell. It doesn’t matter. Because the hands don’t stop. They keep working. Cleaning. Healing.
*page_break Saving the life

A face hovers above ${sol_pronp}. Not clear—just a shadow framed in gold. Their voice is hushed. Urgent. [i]Beautiful[/i]. ${sol_big_pron} would pray, 
if ${sol_pron} still believed prayers went anywhere. But maybe they do, because this—this savior—they feel like one.

The scent of thyme. Water. Cloth brushed against ${sol_pronpp} skin.

${sol_big_pron} flinches. Just barely. A ripple of breath and pain and something sweeter than both. 
And then the cloth again, pressing to the wound at ${sol_pronpp} side. Steady now.

And then there’s [i]another[/i] voice. Older. Softer still. Like lullabies and lullaby-makers. A second pair of hands joins in.

${sol_big_pronpp} thoughts fracture.

${sol_big_pron} doesn’t remember how ${sol_pron} got here. But ${sol_pron} remembers the feeling—that aching pull through the woods. Like fate, or complete madness. 
Like a prayer dragging itself toward its answer on bloodied knees.

${sol_big_pron} catches snippets of words, voices swimming through heat and fog. Something about fever. Bark. A frog in a boot?

${sol_big_pron} would laugh, if ${sol_pronpp} throat weren’t sand and splinters. Instead ${sol_pron} just breathes. Or tries to.

A sound escapes ${sol_pronp}. A groan. Weak and [i]broken[/i] and nothing like that of an heir. But the savior—${sol_pronpp} savior—doesn’t flinch. Doesn’t stop. 
They murmur something. Not to ${sol_pronp}. To someone else. Maybe themselves. Maybe the gods.

The pain stays.

But the fear starts to fade. Just a little. Like it's bleeding out through the wound, pooling into the cloths they press against ${sol_pronpp} side.

Their hands are still on ${sol_pronp}. [i]Warm[/i]. Careful. ${sol_big_pronpp} eyes don’t open, but ${sol_pron} sees the savior anyway.

Not their face. Not yet.

Just the way they don’t look away.

${sol_big_pron} thinks—if ${sol_pron} lives, it will be because of them.

And if ${sol_pron} dies?

${sol_big_pron} hopes it’s the name of [i]${sol_pronpp} angel[/i] on ${sol_pronpp} lips.
*page_break

[b]Your POV[/b]

The room is quieter now.

The fever hasn’t broken, but it’s not climbing anymore either. ${sol_big_pronpp} breathing has evened out—still shallow, still careful, but steadier. 
Your mother’s voice has softened to a hum as she works beside ${sol_pronp}, her hands sure and practiced, movements slowing as the urgency ebbs.

Your father retreated to the other room at some point. You didn’t even hear him go.

You sit back on your heels, blood on your sleeves and the scent of herbs clinging to your skin. The fire crackles low, casting soft shadows across the floorboards. 
The lanterns have burned down to dim embers, and outside, the night holds its breath, stealing your view of what dangers lie just out of reach.

Your limbs ache. The kind of ache that sinks into the bones.

You hadn’t realized how tense you were until now, when the stillness settles around you like a weight—and a quiet voice inside your head finally has space to speak. It doesn’t shout. It whispers.

You’re [i]exhausted[/i]. You’re worried. You’re still not sure who this ${sol_worm} on the table really is.

But you brought ${sol_pronp} back. Whatever else happens, [i]you[/i] did that.

And now—for the first time in what feels like hours—you have a moment to breathe.

To [i]think[/i].

To [i]choose[/i] what comes next.
*choice
	*selectable_if (empathy >= 2) #Stay beside ${sol_pronp}.
		You don’t know what holds you there—whether it’s duty, instinct, or something quieter and deeper—but you stay. 
		The room is hushed now, dim but warm, the fire crackling low and steady in the hearth. 
		Your father has retreated into silence near the doorway, your mother has gone to prepare tinctures, 
		and the only sound left is the soft rhythm of ${sol_big_pron}'s breathing—shallow, uneven, but there.

		You pull up the stool beside ${sol_pron}, your hands still stained with dried blood and crushed herbs. 
		You don’t move to wash the person. Instead, you rest your elbows on your knees and watch ${sol_pron}, this stranger who should mean nothing—and yet.

		${sol_big_pron}’s beautiful in a way that unsettles you. Like something carved into legend, etched in the stars long before you were born. 
		Something [i]ethereal[/i]. Hair damp, golden even under flickering firelight. Lips parted slightly with each breath. 
		Skin too pale. ${sol_big_pron} doesn’t belong to this world, not really. Not here, in your family’s kitchen, 
		on the old table where you used to peel apples in autumn and shell peas in spring.

		But somehow, [i]now[/i], ${sol_pron} does.

		You let the silence grow comfortable. It stretches around you, gentle and undemanding. Every so often, ${sol_pron} shifts—a muscle twitch 
		in ${sol_pronp} arm, a low sound in ${sol_pronp} throat. Fever dreams. Still, you stay. Still, you watch.

		And slowly, slowly, your panic softens into something else. Not calm, not yet. But stillness. [i]Resolve[/i].

		You’ll be here for ${sol_pronp} when ${sol_pron} wakes. You [i]have[/i] to be.
		*set sol_rel +50
		*goto sol_wakes

	#Step outside.
		The warmth of the room presses in around you—too thick, too heavy. You rise slowly, barely making a sound, and slip through the back door. 
		The night air hits you like a wave. Cold. Crisp. Real.

		It rakes through your lungs as you breathe it in, and only then do you realize how tightly your chest had been clenched. 
		How long you’ve gone without truly breathing.

		You walk a few paces into the dark, boots crunching over frost-laced earth. Above, the stars are impossibly clear—shimmering like frost on black velvet. 
		The moon is a silver coin, too bright, too watchful.

		For a moment, you just stand there. Hands on your hips. Head tilted back. Letting the night wrap around your shoulders.

		The wind slips beneath your collar, cool against your skin. You can still feel the heat of ${sol_pronp} on your fingertips—the tremble of fever, 
		the raw wound, the strange weight of responsibility.

		You don’t even know ${sol_pronpp} name. Not really.

		And yet… you brought ${sol_pronp} here. You chose to do so willingly. Maybe not with words, but with action. With instinct. Something in you [i]knew[/i].

		You close your ${eye_color} eyes, and when you open them again, the sky hasn’t changed. But [i]you[/i] have.

		Just a little.

		You head back toward the door. You’re not sure what tomorrow will bring—but for now, the cold has cleared your thoughts.
		*goto sol_wakes2

	#Go to your room.
		You can’t stay in that room. [i]Not right now[/i]. Not with the smell of blood and smoke, the way your mother’s voice softens around 
		words like "fever" and "infection."

		You climb the stairs in silence, feet light out of long habit. At the top, your door waits, half-open. 
		The room beyond is still yours—old clothes folded neatly, books stacked beside the bed, a cracked window you never fixed. 
		It’s the smallest kind of refuge, but it’s yours.

		You shut the door gently behind you and lean against it. Let your head rest there. The weight of the night seeps into your bones.

		You don’t cry. [i]Not exactly[/i]. But your breath hitches once, and then again. A quiet unraveling.

		The pallet creaks as you sink onto it, palms against your thighs. Your hands are still trembling. You rub them together, 
		trying to remember if they’ve ever done something that mattered more.

		${sol_pron}'s alive. [i]You[/i] did that. You don’t know what comes next. But for now—just for now—you sit in the quiet, staring at the ceiling, 
		and let the stillness hold you.
		*goto sol_wakes2

	#Ask your mother what she thinks.
		You find her at the washbasin, sleeves damp, hands steady. She doesn’t look up as you enter, but somehow she knows it’s you.

		"${sol_pron}’s resting," she says. "Fever’s high, but ${sol_pron}'s holding on."

		You nod, stepping closer. The words come slow. "Do you… think ${sol_pron}’ll live?"

		She glances over at you. Her eyes are [i]tired[/i], but warm. "I’ve seen worse come back. I’ve seen better slip away. 
		It’s not just the wounds—it’s [i]the will[/i]."

		She rinses a cloth, wrings it out. The water runs red for a moment, then clear.

		"And what do you think of ${sol_pronp}?" you ask, almost [i]afraid[/i] of the answer.

		She’s quiet for a moment. Then: "I think ${sol_pron}'s not what ${sol_pron} seems. And I think ${sol_pron}'s more than ${sol_pron} knows."

		She turns to face you fully, wiping her hands on her apron. "But what I think doesn’t matter. You brought ${sol_pronp} here. 
		[i]Your[/i] choice. That means something."

		You swallow, throat tight. "I didn’t know what else to do."

		She nods. "That’s how most important things begin."

		You let her words settle. Let them echo in the spaces you didn’t know were hollow.

	*selectable_if (empathy >= 3) #Touch ${sol_pronpp} hand.
		You hesitate at first.

		It feels foolish. Sentimental. [i]Unnecessary[/i].

		But the pull is there. Small and persistent.

		You reach out, slow and careful, until your fingers brush ${sol_pronp}. ${sol_big_pronpp} skin is hot—burning, even—but there’s life there. A pulse. 
		A whisper.

		You press your hand to ${sol_pronp}, palms aligned, and let the silence wrap around you. ${sol_big_pronpp} fingers are longer than yours, rougher. 
		${sol_big_pron} looks too [i]fragile[/i] like this, out of place and out of time.

		And you wonder—what brought ${sol_pronp} to you?

		Because you can’t believe it was accident. Not truly.

		You curl your fingers just slightly. Enough to hold on. Enough to make a promise, even if no one hears it but you.

		You stay like that for a long while, hand in ${sol_pronpp}, watching the shadows shift on the walls.

	#Pray.
		You [i]kneel[/i].

		Not in the way they taught you, stiff-backed and rule-bound. This is quieter. Smaller. [i]Messier[/i].

		Your hands are still stained, your knees press into the floorboards, and your voice shakes as you speak. 
		Not to the gods of stone halls and crimson-robed priests.

		Just… to [i]something[/i].

		"[i]Please[/i]," you whisper. "Please let ${sol_pronp} stay. Let ${sol_pronp} survive this."

		You don’t ask for answers. Or forgiveness. Or signs. Just that ${sol_pron} lives.

		The silence that follows isn’t empty.

		It’s listening.

		Somewhere behind you, a log shifts in the hearth. Sparks rise.

		You close your eyes. You don’t know who you’re talking to. But maybe it doesn’t matter.

		[i]Maybe it never did[/i].

[i]It’s been days.[/i]

Long ones. Quiet ones. The kind where the hours blur and fold into one another like damp parchment, where time moves like honey over stone.

You’ve barely left the room.

Your mother brings food you forget to eat. Your father lingers sometimes in the doorway but says little. 
They’ve learned not to ask—not when you keep returning to the side of the bed like gravity’s stronger there, like your heart’s tethered to the stranger 
who hasn’t stirred in days.

${sol_big_pron} breathes. Shallow, feverish, but steady. And that’s been enough to keep you still. To keep you waiting.

You’ve changed the bandages. Washed ${sol_pronpp} face. Brushed the sweat-damp hair from ${sol_pronpp} brow again and again like some prayer with no name. 
You’ve whispered to ${sol_pronp}, even when your voice grew hoarse and your hope thinner.

But today—[i]something shifts[/i]. It starts with a breath.

Shallow. Ragged. But different from before.

You lift your head from where it’s rested too long beside ${sol_pronp}, cheek stiff against your folded arms. The fire’s burned low, casting the room in soft, 
flickering gold. Shadows stretch long over ${sol_pronpp} still form, and for a moment, you think you imagined it—that fragile shift of air, that almost-movement.

But then ${sol_pronpp} fingers twitch.

Not much. Just a tremble. But you see it.

“Hey,” you whisper, unsure if it’s to wake ${sol_pronp} or to keep yourself steady.

${sol_big_pronpp} brow furrows, faint and flickering. Like a dream chasing ${sol_pronp}. ${sol_big_pron} shifts again—barely, but more this time—and 
a broken sound scrapes from the back of ${sol_pronpp} throat. [i]Raw. Lost.[/i]
*page_break Your heart stumbles

You reach for the damp cloth on ${sol_pronpp} brow, now gone warm, and trade it out for a cooler one. ${sol_big_pronpp} skin is still too hot beneath 
your fingers, but not scalding—not like before.

And then ${sol_pronpp} eyes flutter.

Once. Twice. Struggling, heavy. Caught between sleep and something deeper.

You lean closer.

“Hey,” you say again, quieter now. “You’re safe.”

${sol_big_pronpp} breath catches. A shudder rolls through ${sol_pronp}. And finally, slowly, those golden eyes open.

Barely slits. Glazed and dazed and unfocused. [i]But open[/i].

${sol_big_pron} looks at you—and then looks through you. Just the haze of fever, the confusion of pain. ${sol_big_pronpp} lips part like ${sol_pron} means to speak, 
but nothing comes out. ${sol_big_pron} tries again. Fails. Blinks.

And then—soft, hoarse, a breath more than a word—“Are you...”

${sol_big_pronpp} gaze lingers on your face like it’s the only thing anchoring ${sol_pronp} to this world. ${sol_big_pronpp} 
fingers curl weakly at ${sol_pronpp} side, grasping at nothing. The words are broken when they come.

[i]“Are you... real?”[/i]

You nod. You should say something. Should smile, offer comfort, reassure ${sol_pronp}—but your throat is tight and your chest aches and all you can do is 
reach out and let your fingers brush against ${sol_pronpp}, gently.

[i]“Angel.”[/i]
*page_break Next

You blink. “What?”

“You... stayed.” ${sol_big_pronpp} voice is a breathless rasp. “I remember... [i]warmth[/i]. Hands. You didn’t leave.”

“No,” you say softly. “I didn’t.”

${sol_big_pron} looks at you like ${sol_pron} still doesn’t quite believe it. Like ${sol_pron} expects the illusion to fade. ${sol_big_pronpp} breathing is shallow but steadying now, 
${sol_pronpp} gaze clearer by the second.

“Every time... I fell under,” ${sol_pron} murmurs, “I heard your voice. I followed it. Like a... a tether.”

You don’t know what to say. So you stay beside ${sol_pronp}, fingers resting lightly against ${sol_pronpp}. Letting ${sol_pronp} see that you’re here. Still here.

${sol_big_pronpp} hand, slow and trembling, shifts until your fingers are tangled.

“I thought...” ${sol_big_pron} swallows, and the effort costs ${sol_pronp}. “I thought I was dead.”

“You’re not,” you whisper.

${sol_big_pronpp} eyes are locked to yours, like you’re some impossible dream. ${sol_big_pronpp} lips part again, and this time the word makes it out.

“Don’t go,” ${sol_pron} whispers.

“I won’t.”

And you mean it. Every word.

Because somehow, in the quiet between life and whatever was waiting beyond it, ${sol_pron} reached for you.

And now—${sol_pron}’s holding on.
*page_break Next
*goto talk_sol

*set sol_wake_scene 2
[i]It’s been a few days.[/i]

You haven’t stayed at ${sol_pronpp} side—not constantly, not like some would have. You’ve come and gone, always meaning to return sooner than you do. 
But time slips strangely in this room, stretching long and thin between each shallow breath ${sol_pron} takes.

The fever broke sometime in the night. You know because your mother said so. She’d touched ${sol_pronpp} forehead with the back of her hand and nodded like it meant something final, 
something hopeful. But still, ${sol_pron} hasn’t woken.

You sit now because you feel like you should. Because there’s something about ${sol_pronp} that draws you in—has drawn you in since you found ${sol_pronp} bleeding in the woods 
like some myth pulled loose from the pages of a storybook. Golden-haired and broken. Crownless, nameless. [i]Strange[/i].

${sol_big_pron} shifts.

Just a flicker. A breath that catches in ${sol_pronpp} throat and stutters out.

You lean forward, heart suddenly thudding too hard against your ribs. You watch ${sol_pronpp} lashes flutter, dark against sweat-slick skin. ${sol_big_pronpp} lips part—dry, 
cracked—and something like a sound slips out, more [i]air[/i] than voice.

Then—${sol_pronp} eyes open.
*page_break Next

Not fully. Just a sliver. Gold-flecked and glassy, slow to focus. But they find [i]you[/i].

For a moment, ${sol_pron} doesn’t move. Doesn’t blink. Just looks at you, like ${sol_pron} doesn’t know if ${sol_pron}’s awake or dreaming. 
Like ${sol_pron}’s trying to make sense of your face.

And then, faintly—barely even there—${sol_pron} whispers, “…are you… an angel?”

You almost smile. You don’t. Your throat’s too tight.

${sol_big_pron} blinks again, slower this time. “I thought… I saw wings.”

You glance down at yourself. No wings. Just a worn tunic and tired hands.

Still, ${sol_pron} watches you like ${sol_pron}’s seeing something [i]sacred[/i]. Like whatever ${sol_pron} imagined in the haze of fever isn’t gone yet. 
Like you’ve stepped out of a vision ${sol_pron} doesn’t want to lose.

“You brought me back,” ${sol_pron} murmurs.

You start to speak—but stop. What is there to say to someone who’s bleeding out one moment and calling you an [i]angel[/i] the next?

So you just sit there. Quiet. Still.

Let ${sol_pronp} look at you. Let ${sol_pronp} [i]breathe[/i].

And for a moment, in the hush of this half-lit room, you wonder if maybe—just maybe—${sol_pron}’s not entirely wrong.
*page_break Next
*goto talk_sol

*label talk_sol
${sol_big_pron} sleeps through the morning.

You check in and out of the room—bring broth once, fresh water again. 
Sometimes you find ${sol_pronp} breathing slow and even, sunk deep into dreams. 
Other times ${sol_pronpp} brow creases like something inside ${sol_pronp} aches in ways even fever couldn’t burn clean. But the fever’s gone. 
The worst of it, anyway.

You’re not sure what draws you back to the room. [i]Curiosity[/i], maybe. Guilt. A thread you can’t quite cut.

The fever broke last night. Your mother said ${sol_pron} would live. But still—something in you itches with unfinishedness, like leaving a page unread.

When you step through the door once more, ${sol_pron}'s awake.

Propped awkwardly on one elbow, blinking blearily toward the window. Golden light spills across ${sol_pronpp} face, catching in the pale mess of ${sol_pronpp} hair, 
but ${sol_pronpp} expression is muddled. [i]Dazed[/i]. Unsettled in the way someone is when the world they wake into doesn’t quite match the one they left behind.
*page_break You hesitate in the doorway.

${sol_big_pronpp} gaze slides to you, unfocused at first. Then it sharpens. Slowly.

[i]“You,”[/i] ${sol_pron} says, voice hoarse with sleep and healing and something [i]softer[/i].

You nod. [i]“Me.”[/i]

${sol_big_pron} doesn’t smile, not exactly—but there’s relief in ${sol_pronpp} face. A flicker of something that almost makes you want to take a step closer.

“I thought you were a dream,” ${sol_pron} says, leaning ${sol_pronpp} head back against the pillow like the effort of speaking might knock ${sol_pronp} over. 
“You were there. The herbs. The cloth. You didn’t [i]leave[/i].”

*goto shared_scene

*label wake_scene_two
“I didn’t,” you say quietly. “I stayed.”

His eyes—still glazed from fever, but clearer than before—find yours again.

For a moment, he just looks at you. Like he’s trying to decide if he heard you right. Like maybe he doesn’t deserve that kind of truth.

Then he breathes out. A small sound, too rough to be a laugh, too soft to be anything else.

“Still,” he murmurs, lids fluttering low. “You stayed.”

As if that word—[i]you[/i]—is something sacred.

As if your presence alone held him tethered to the world.
*goto shared_scene

*label shared_scene
You cross the room slowly, careful not to knock the bowl on the floor. Sit beside the low bed with your hands folded in your lap.

“You were thrown,” you say. “Off a horse. Deep in the woods.”

Something flashes across ${sol_pronpp} face at that—recognition, then discomfort. ${sol_big_pronpp} jaw tenses, just for a moment.

“There was a hunt,” ${sol_pron} says. “I think.”

“You don’t remember?”

“Bits.” ${sol_pron} swallows, gaze dropping to the blanket pulled over ${sol_pronpp} legs. “Trees. Hooves. A fall. That’s all.”

You wait.

And wait.

But ${sol_pron} doesn’t say more.

“What were you doing out there alone?”

A pause. Then, casually—[i]too casually[/i]: “It was meant to be a short ride. I got separated.”

Another pause.

“I wasn’t trying to get injured and cause any inconvenience,” ${sol_pron} adds, almost like it hurts to admit it.

“Well. Too late for that.”

Your words land lighter than you feel. There's something behind ${sol_pronpp} eyes that makes your stomach tighten—caution laced with practiced ease. 
A ${sol_worm} used to choosing every word with care.

${sol_big_pron} shifts again, slower this time. “What’s your name?”
*page_break Next

You tell ${sol_pronp}. Watch how ${sol_pron} repeats it to ${sol_pronp}self, barely audible. Like ${sol_pron} wants to remember it, like ${sol_pron} [i]needs[/i] to.

When you ask for ${sol_pronpp} name, ${sol_pron} doesn’t answer right away.

And then: “Sol.”

You blink. “Sol?”

“It’s enough, isn’t it?”

That easy smile tugging at the corner of ${sol_pronpp} mouth. It’s almost convincing. [i]Almost[/i].

You don’t believe ${sol_pronp}.

But you let it go.

Because there are bruises on ${sol_pronpp} ribs and blood still staining the hem of your cloak. Because ${sol_pron} winces when ${sol_pron} breathes too deeply. 
Because something about ${sol_pronp}, for all ${sol_pronpp} polished caution, feels real in a way that makes you want to look [i]closer[/i].

Maybe one day ${sol_pron}’ll tell you the rest.

But for now… [i]“Sol”[/i] is enough.
*page_break The End... For Now...

[i]That’s all for now.[/i]

The story pauses here, but only for a breath. I'm already deep in the next chapter—unraveling secrets, shaping choices, 
and pulling threads that will take you further into Ashwood and everything it hides.

If something lingered with you—whether a moment, a line, or just the feel of the forest under your skin—I’d love to hear it. 
Your feedback means the world and helps shape where the path leads next!

Thank you for playing.
Thank you for reading.
And thank you for walking with me into the dark.

Until soon.
