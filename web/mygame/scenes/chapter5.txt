[b]Chapter 5 - Beneath the Ashes[/b]

The air is thick with incense and smoke — not comforting, but cloying, like it’s hiding something rotten underneath.

A chamber carved deep into the rock. No windows. No light, save the steady flicker of braziers that burn without wood. 
Their flames curl too smoothly, too slowly — as if obeying something other than wind or breath.

Two figures stand at the center.

One is cloaked in layered gray, head bowed, voice thin and dry as parchment.

“The wards have held, but only just. Their names are being whispered again. Some remember more than they should.”

The other man — tall, veiled in black and shadow — does not answer at first. 
He stands still, one hand resting on the edge of the stone altar, running over it. 
Almost [i]seductively[/i]. The runes carved into it pulse faintly, like veins beneath the skin.

When he speaks, it’s low and deliberate. Not a voice meant to persuade — a voice meant to bend.

“Let ${possessive_pronouns} remember.”

The priest shifts, uneasy. “That was not the plan. [i]Exposure[/i] this early could ruin—”

“The plan,” the man interrupts, [i]gently[/i], “is alive. It grows. Twists. Learns.”

He finally moves — a single step forward. The shadows [i]stretch[/i] with him.
*page_break Next

“They built a world from the ashes of my bones. They think it's theirs now. But they forget…”
A pause. A smile you can’t see, but [i]feel[/i].
“...ashes don’t stay buried forever.”

“You swore to remain hidden until—”

“Until I could stand again. Until I [i]remembered[/i] who I was.”

He looks up. You still can’t see his face — only the gleam of his eyes, catching the brazier’s glow like molten gold.

“I remember now.”

A silence coils through the room. Not empty — listening.

The priest bows lower. “And the others? The vessels? They’re not complete. They’re still scattered.”

“They’ll come. They always do. Even the stars bend to gravity, eventually.”

He touches the altar again — almost [i]reverent[/i]. The runes flare briefly under his palm once again, then dim.

“I don’t need all of them yet. Just one spark. Just one flame willing to burn.”

And then:

“When ${pronouns} begins to unravel, they will come running. And when they do—”
He lifts his hand. The brazier’s flame erupts, twisting into a spiral of gold and black.
“—I’ll be waiting.”

[i]The fire dies instantly.[/i]

Darkness swallows the chamber — but something lingers.

Not silence. Not stillness.
A [i]pull[/i].

It begins in your chest, low and slow, like your heartbeat has remembered a rhythm older than you. Older than this world.

You take a breath — but there’s no air.

Only starlight.

It leaks in through the cracks in the stone. A thin thread at first, then more. Dozens. [i]Hundreds[/i]. 
Glimmering like veins of silver through black marble, spiderwebbing across the walls, the altar, the floor beneath your feet.

You blink—
And the chamber is gone.

[i]The world turns[/i].

Your body isn’t yours.
Not fully. You’re floating, drifting weightless through a place that feels like memory — not yours, but close enough to taste.

The air here is softer. Heavy with rosewater, distant thunder, and something sharper beneath — something holy.

Below you, a great hall stretches out in broken majesty. Shattered pillars. Collapsed arches. Vines growing up the ribs of a [i]forgotten[/i] throne.

You see [i]her[/i] again.

She stands in the center of the ruin, cloaked in twilight. Not turning. Not yet.
A woman made of contradiction — gentle and vast, fragile and terrifying, like the sea pretending to sleep.

This time, she speaks without sound.

[i]”Thou shouldst not have come hither.”[/i]

The stars behind her shift.
You fall toward them.
*page_break

You are not waking. [i]Not yet[/i].

The cold that clings to your skin in the waking world hasn’t followed you here. Not yet. Here, the air is warm — but wrong. 
It hums with silence, like breath held too long.

You stand on a floor of shattered marble, veins of gold threading through every crack like lightning frozen mid-sky. 
The ceiling arches above you, endless, a cathedral carved from starlight — or what’s left of it. Time has eaten this place hollow. 
Ivy coils up the columns. Dust lingers in sunbeams that don’t seem to come from any sun at all.

And yet… it feels familiar.
Not in the way a memory does.
In the way a [i]heartbeat[/i] does.

You move without willing it, feet echoing softly on broken stone. The hush deepens as you reach the far end of the chamber — and find [i]her[/i].
*page_break

A woman stands with her back to you.
She is tall. Still. [i]Radiant[/i] in a way that hurts to look at.
Her hair flows like water catching moonlight, and her robes shift between white and deep violet, like clouds before a storm.

She says nothing. But you feel her [i]knowing[/i] you — feel it like a hand on your chest, pressing. Testing. [i]Measuring[/i].

When she speaks, it’s not with a mouth. The words are thought. [i]Soundless[/i]. Unshakable.

[i]“Never did I dream thee wouldst come so far.”[/i]

She turns.

And your breath stops.
Because her face is not hers.
It’s eerily similar to [i]yours[/i].

Not as you are now — but older. Wiser. [i]Hollowed[/i].
You see pain behind your own eyes. Power, too. Terrible and holy.
You flinch, but she steps forward — and with her comes warmth, fierce and aching, like sunlight through armor cracks.

[i]“Too soon thou wakest, child of flame,”[/i] she says, voice still inside your head. [i]"But the [i]veil[/i] has thinned."[/i]

The world shivers.

Flashes — like a blade catching light — slice across your vision.

[i]A tower shattering under moonlight

A crown of feathers and flame

A name written in blood on the walls of a palace

A man’s smile carved from shadow

And a hand, outstretched toward you — waiting — no,[/i] [b]pulling[/b]

You try to speak, but your throat burns.
You fall to your knees. The floor [i]cracks[/i] beneath your palms.

She kneels beside you. Her voice wraps around your ribs like a prayer:

[i]"They shall come for thee, little star.
Not for what thou art…
But for that which I hath left within thee.”[/i]

Her hand touches your heart — and something inside you flares.
Not pain. Not heat.
[i]Recognition[/i].
Like a match being struck in a room full of gas.

You look up — but she’s already fading.
Turning into light, and ashes, and echo.

[i]Trust not the one who knoweth thy name too soon.
He shall set the world to flame,
If only to grasp what remains of thee[/i]

And then—

[i]The starlight shatters.[/i]
*page_break You gasp awake
*goto next_part

*label scene_low_veilsense
The fire dies.

But you don't wake.

Not yet.

Something clings to you — like smoke under the skin, like a voice speaking just behind your ear.

The chamber begins to dissolve. The stone melts into mist. The altar fades.

You’re falling.

No — floating.
Pulled sideways through a dream you don’t remember entering.

A flicker.

A throne, [i]shattered[/i] in half.

A woman with a face you almost recognize — staring through you, not at you.

A scream, distant and muffled, like it’s underwater.

And then —
A man’s hand, outstretched.

Not offering.
[i]Taking[/i].

The image shatters before you can see his face.

Your chest tightens. Your skin burns cold. Something inside you twists — not in pain, but recognition.
Like you’ve forgotten something important.
Like you’re not supposed to be here.

A final whisper, barely audible — not a voice, more like a thought that isn’t yours:

[i]“She doth awaken.”[/i]

And then—
*page_break You gasp awake
*goto next_part

*label next_part
Sweat slicks your skin. Your pulse hammers in your throat.
It’s morning — or close. The light is pale and bruised around the edges. Birds outside. Someone’s voice in the distance. [i]Familiar[/i].

But you can’t shake it — that sense of being watched, even now.

The dream fades quickly.

Too quickly.

Only fragments remain, slippery and fading fast:

[i]Gold light.

Black flame.

Eyes gleaming in the dark.[/i]

You don’t remember what was said. Or who said it.
But something about it felt… personal.

Like a promise.

Or a [i]warning[/i].

	#Sit with the dream. Try to write it down
		The images linger like shadows behind your eyes — a flicker of molten gold, a spiral of black flame, eyes gleaming in the dark. 
		They slip away the moment you try to grasp them, elusive and maddening. 
		But something about this dream clings tighter than the rest, demanding you hold onto it, understand it before it vanishes completely.

		You find a quiet corner, a place where the morning light filters softly through the wooden slats of your room. 
		Your hands tremble as you reach for your journal, the familiar weight a small comfort in the swirling confusion. 
		You steady your breath, fingers poised over the page, and begin to write.

		The words come slowly at first, fragmented like the dream itself. 
		Symbols you can barely name, voices that speak in riddles, the shadowed figure cloaked in black. 
		You trace the spiral of flame, the pulsing runes carved into stone. 
		You try to capture the feeling — the cold tendrils of unease, the tightening coil in your chest, the whispered warning that something is coming.

		As you write, the haze in your mind clears just enough to let you see the edges of a terrible truth. 
		There’s power inside you, ancient and dangerous. And there are others who know — who are waiting. 
		Waiting for you to awaken fully, to unravel the secret buried deep in your blood.

		You feel the weight of the knowledge pressing down, heavy and unyielding. But at least now, it’s no longer a shadow without shape. 
		You have begun to name the darkness.

		When you finally set your pen down, your hands are clammy but steady. The room feels colder somehow, the silence thicker. 
		Outside, the village stirs to life, but here you sit, holding a sliver of truth in your hands.

		[i]What will you do with it?[/i]

	#Go find Kai. Maybe he can ground you
		The dream leaves you unsettled, like a thread pulled too tight beneath your skin. 
		You don’t trust yourself to be alone with these thoughts — [i]not yet[/i]. Your steps take you toward the familiar, toward [i]Kai[/i].

		You find them near the well, leaning against the rough stone, eyes half-lidded as they watch the sky. 
		The easy quiet between you is a balm — the steady presence you didn’t know you needed until now. 
		Kai’s glance sharpens when they see the [i]tension[/i] etched across your face.

		Without waiting for you to speak, they fall into step beside you. Their voice is soft but steady. “You look like you’ve been chasing ghosts.”

		You want to tell them everything, but the words catch in your throat. Instead, you let the silence stretch, letting them offer comfort without pressure.

		Kai’s presence is [i]grounding[/i], like a lighthouse cutting through the storm. 
		You share memories, half-remembered stories from your childhood, laughter spilling between you like a fragile promise. 
		For a moment, the darkness loosens its grip.

		But beneath the surface, you sense Kai’s silent [i]yearning[/i] — the question left unasked, the love held back by respect and [i]fear[/i].

		You wonder if you could ever return it. For now, you just lean into the quiet, grateful for the steadiness beneath the chaos.

	*selectable_if (mother_rel >= 80) #Seek out your mother
		You find her in the kitchen, hands deep in flour, sleeves rolled past the elbows. 
		Sunlight filters in through the crooked shutters, catching in her silver-threaded hair. 
		The scent of yeast and honey clings to the air — warm, familiar. Safe.

		She looks up as you enter, her expression softening instantly. “You’re up early, little star,” she says, using the name she hasn’t in years.

		You try to respond with a smile, but it falters halfway. The dream still clings to your skin like ash, souring your thoughts.

		She sees it — of course she does. She always does. She wipes her hands on a cloth, gestures gently. “Come. Sit. I’ll make tea.”

		You sit. You watch the steam curl from the kettle as she moves through the small space with practiced ease. It should be comforting. 
		It used to be. But something inside you is restless, like you’re sitting inside the memory of a home, not the real thing.

		She places the tea in front of you. Her fingers linger on the rim of the cup for just a second too long.

		“You had another one, didn’t you?”

		You nod.

		She doesn’t press for details. Instead, she sinks into the chair beside you, reaching for her own cup. The silence stretches, but not unkindly.

		“You used to wake crying,” she says quietly. “When you were little. Couldn’t tell me why — not at first. 
		Just tears and shaking and that look in your eyes… like you'd seen something no child should.”

		You glance at her, startled. You hadn’t remembered that.

		She chuckles, a little sadly. “You wouldn’t sleep unless I sang. Do you remember that old lullaby?”

		She hums it under her breath, just a few bars — the melody achingly familiar. Your chest [i]tightens[/i].

		“I used to think,” she murmurs, “that maybe you remembered something from before. Something… you weren’t meant to carry.”

		You swallow, the tea suddenly bitter on your tongue. “Did I?”

		A pause. Her eyes flick toward the window, out to where the morning has begun in earnest. “I don’t know,” she says. 
		“Or maybe I just told myself stories so I wouldn’t be afraid for you.”

		There’s something behind her words. A quiet ache. A truth she won’t let surface — not yet.

		“I remember you holding me,” you say, voice barely more than breath. “That night the barn caught fire. Everyone was screaming. 
		You just held me, wrapped in your shawl. You didn’t say a word, just… held on.”

		She looks at you then, and her eyes are wet. “I was so scared,” she whispers. 
		“But you weren’t. You just looked at the flames, like they couldn’t touch you.”

		The silence that follows isn’t empty. It’s full of all the things neither of you know how to ask.

		Finally, she squeezes your hand. “Go see your father when you can. He’s been carving again — says the trees are whispering at him.”

		You raise an eyebrow, and she laughs. “I told him to stop drinking the elderflower wine before bed, but he never listens.”

		It breaks the heaviness a little. You let her laughter wrap around you, and for a moment, the world feels solid again.

		But the weight of the dream remains — not forgotten, only waiting.

	*selectable_if (father_rel >= 80) #Go find your father in the grove
		The path to the grove winds like an old scar — half-overgrown, soft with moss and pine needles. You know the way by heart.

		Your father is there, as always, seated on the old stump beneath the three-limbed birch. 
		A half-carved figure rests in his lap, pale wood curling in thin strips beneath the movement of his knife. 
		He doesn’t look up when you approach. Doesn’t need to.

		“Took you long enough,” he murmurs, the words slow and even. “Thought maybe the forest had kept you this time.”

		You ease down beside him on the grass. “Would that be such a terrible thing?”

		He makes a noncommittal sound. The knife works on.

		“You dreamed again,” he says — not a question.

		You nod.

		He exhales through his nose. “The way you used to scream as a child... your mother thought it was nightmares. I always thought they were echoes.”

		You glance at him. “Echoes of what?”

		He pauses the carving. Tilts the figure in the light. “That’s the thing with echoes,” he says. “They’re never where they start. Just where they bounce.”

		He hands you the wooden figure without looking — a small, rough form with wings folded at its back. 
		Not quite human. Not quite creature. Its eyes are shut.

		“I’ve made that one before,” he says. “Years ago. Burned it, even. But it keeps showing up again. In the grain, in the knots. Like the wood remembers.”

		You turn it in your hand. It’s light. Hollow, almost.

		“Do you know what it is?” you ask.

		He shrugs. “No more than I know what you are. But the shape is older than you. And older things… they don’t stay buried.”

		A breeze stirs through the grove — soft, but it lifts the hair from your neck like breath.

		“Some trees grow straight,” he continues, “some twist. You don’t blame the tree for its shape — you blame the storm that bent it. 
		Or the sun that never touched it right.”

		You’re not sure if he’s still talking about the carving.

		“Did you dream, too?” you ask.

		This time, he smiles — slow, crooked. “I stopped dreaming the day we found you.”

		He leans forward, plants the blade of the knife into the soil between you. 
		“But I remember the sky that night. Red as blood. Birds falling from it like ash.”

		He looks up at you then — properly looks — and for the briefest moment, his eyes seem too old. Like something vast is watching from behind them.

		“Whatever’s waking in you,” he says quietly, “it’s not new. It’s just… been waiting.”

		He stands with a grunt, wipes his hands on his trousers. “Come help me gather kindling. And don’t touch that rowan — it sings too loud.”

	#Go find Sol... let ${sol_pronp} help you and care for you
		The lingering shadows of the dream press down on your chest, making your breath shallow and unsteady. 
		You need something — or someone — to remind you you’re still tethered to the world you know.

		[b]Sol[/b].

		You seek ${sol_pronp} out, finding ${sol_pronp} by the river where the water rushes cold and clear. 
		${sol_big_pronpp} presence is a steadying force, solid and real. 
		When ${sol_pron} sees you, ${sol_pronpp} face softens, concern flickering in ${sol_pronpp} eyes.

		"You look like you’ve been fighting a storm inside you, Angel," ${sol_pron} says quietly.

		You don’t have to explain. ${sol_big_pron} reaches out, 
		*if (hair_length = "extremely short")
			${sol_pronpp} hand gently brushing against your cheek, grounding you with the warmth of ${sol_pronpp} touch.

		*if (hair_length = "very long")
			brushing a stray lock of ${hair_color} hair from your face, grounding you with the warmth of ${sol_pronpp} touch.

		You lean into ${sol_pronp}, letting the steady rhythm of ${sol_pronpp} heartbeat anchor you. 
		For the first time since the dream, your walls crumble, and you allow the fear and confusion to spill out.

		${sol_big_pron} listens without judgment, holding you gently in ${sol_pronpp} arms. The world doesn’t feel so dark here, not with ${sol_pronp}.

		But beneath the comfort, you sense the fragile thread of ${sol_pronpp} own fears — the fear of losing you, 
		the silent hope that ${sol_pron} might become more than a shelter from the storm.

		You don’t know what the future holds, but in this moment, you let yourself be held.

Morning comes slow.
Like the village itself is reluctant to wake — reluctant to face whatever the night stirred up.

You lie there for a while, curled under the thin quilt, watching the light stretch across the wooden beams overhead. 
Dust dances in the slanting gold, shifting like motes of memory.

Your chest still feels heavy. Not painful, exactly — more like the ache left behind after crying too hard, or remembering something you weren’t ready to know.

Whatever it was you dreamed… it's already slipping through your fingers.

Just a few jagged pieces remain:

[i]A voice wrapped in shadows.
The smell of smoke and stone.
Eyes that gleamed like they knew you.[/i]

You draw a shaky breath. Sit up. The floorboards creak beneath your bare feet.

Outside, the village murmurs awake — soft voices, the creak of old doors, the sharp bark of a dog too eager to greet the sun. Familiar sounds. Safe ones.

You should get up. Move. Ground yourself.

Not because it will make the questions go away — but because the world doesn’t pause for you to find the answers.
*page_break Next

When you finally step outside, the sun is low and warm on your skin. The village smells of bread and smoke, damp earth and sweetgrass. It smells like home.

Kai is already across the square, sleeves rolled up, repairing one of the old water troughs. They look up when they hear your steps — give a short wave, 
half-shielding their eyes from the light.

“Sleep okay?”
The question is casual. But their eyes search yours too carefully for it to be simple.

Sol is nearby, sitting on the low stone wall near the chickens, sun in ${sol_pronpp} hair and a book half-open in ${sol_pronpp} lap. 
${sol_big_pron}’s pretending to read — but you feel the tension in ${sol_pronpp} posture. Like ${sol_pron}’s listening more than watching.

You could speak to either of them. Or just… walk. Let the rhythm of the day settle into you.

There’s a strange peace in the air today.

But somewhere beneath it — like the echo of a bell you can’t quite hear — something else stirs.

*label Ashwood_morning
It is a slow morning, and you still have some time left before you have to visit Lysandra to buy medical equipment.
*choice
	*disable_reuse #Go prank the villagers with Kai
		It starts with a look. Kai catches your eye as you pass by the well, one brow raised just enough to be dangerous. 
		You don’t even need to speak. The grin curling at the edge of their mouth says it all.

		"So," they murmur, falling into step beside you. "You ever wanted to see Old Marla scream like a startled goat?"

		You blink. "Is that a real question?"

		Kai's laugh is soft but wicked, a sound that warms your ribs. "Thought so. Come on. I have flour, string, and a chicken with a mean attitude."

		Ashwood, for all its quiet charm, isn’t exactly a thrilling place. But with Kai, even a single morning can feel like a secret shared with the gods. 
		The two of you sneak behind stalls and barns, weaving between hanging laundry and abandoned crates like seasoned saboteurs.

		Your first target: the baker's delivery crate. With a bit of clever string and an innocently placed sack of flour, 
		Kai rigs it to puff like a ghost when opened. The timing is perfect. When Old Marla yanks the lid off, the flour explodes like a snowstorm, 
		coating her hair in a perfect white pouf.

		Kai grabs your hand and bolts, stifling laughter, the two of you ducking behind the nearby stable. 
		You’re both breathless with laughter, crouched in the hay, clutching your sides.

		"You are the worst influence," you wheeze.

		"And yet," Kai grins, eyes sparkling, "you keep coming back."
		
		Your next target is the town notice board — and the endless stack of poorly written poetry tacked to it by a certain lovesick apprentice. 
		With a borrowed quill and Kai’s surprisingly neat handwriting, you edit a few verses just enough to be confusing. 
		“Your lips like plump radishes / O, my moon cabbage heart” now reads more like an ode to soup than romance. 
		You even draw a few hearts beside it for flair.

		When the apprentice finds it later, Kai clutches your arm to keep from wheezing aloud as they mutter, [i]“I don’t remember writing that.”[/i]
		
		"Where now?" you ask. Kai's mouth only stretches into a wide grin.
		*page_break The smithy
		
		You slip in while the blacksmith’s out for lunch, Kai hauling a suspiciously realistic-looking wax beetle the size of your fist. 
		It’s placed expertly inside a helmet, just where the eye slit catches the light. 
		The scream that follows when the apprentice lifts the helm could rival a banshee. The poor lad bolts down the lane, helmet still in hand.

		Kai looks at you, deadpan. “Truly, we do the gods' work.”

		But the crown jewel — [i]the masterpiece[/i] — is the old water barrel near the inn. 
		With a bit of sleight of hand and an alarming amount of sticky resin, Kai turns it into a trap. 
		The lid now springs open when nudged, revealing a chorus of frogs gathered earlier by the stream.

		You wait behind a barrel as innkeeper Toma lumbers out with a pail. 
		The moment he kicks the barrel open, a frog leaps directly onto his shoulder. 
		He shouts, staggers, and flails — and three more hop free, croaking in indignant harmony.

		[b]“WHO PUT FROGS IN MY RAINWATER?”[/b]

		Kai's eyes are watering from laughter. “They looked thirsty!”

		Eventually, your energy starts to wane. The adrenaline fades, the village settles, and you're back on the orchard edge, 
		letting your laughter die down like embers. Your heart still beats lighter than it has in days.

		Kai stretches beside you, arms behind their head. “Best part is,” they say dreamily, 
		“you can always tell who needed the laugh the most. They’re the ones who stay mad the least.”

		You hum, glancing up at the clouds, where one looks suspiciously like the chicken from earlier.

		“Maybe tomorrow,” you say, “we prank each other.”

		Kai snorts. “Now that would be war.”

		But it’s not war, not really. It’s knowing someone well enough to pull them back into joy. And being known enough to follow.

		"People think pranks are just jokes," Kai says, quieter now. "But sometimes, they’re just... ways to make someone laugh when they forgot how."

		They glance at you. "You laughed today. That matters."

		You want to say something in return, but instead, you just breathe. The wind rustles the trees. The sky stretches wide above you.

		[i]It’s a good morning.[/i]

	*disable_reuse #Talk about poetry and religion with Sol
		You find Sol in ${sol_pronpp} newly favored place, perched on the low stone wall near the western fields. 
		A book rests in ${sol_pronpp} lap, open but unread. The light catches in ${sol_pronpp} hair, and there's 
		a half-finished thought on ${sol_pronpp} lips when ${sol_pron} sees you.

		"You're up," ${sol_pron} says softly. "Good. The sky always looks lonelier without you in it, [i]Angel[/i]."

		${sol_big_pron} shifts to make space, and you sit beside ${sol_pronp}. The quiet between you feels like something sacred—not holy, but honest.

		“What are you reading?” you ask.

		Sol holds up the book. The binding is old, the cover worn thin. “Lytherian verses. The forbidden ones.” 
		${sol_big_pron} flips it open to a dog-eared page, then smirks faintly. “The kind [i]The Light[/i] would burn me for. 
		The Light of Valtessa doesn't much care for poetry that feels like touch. [i]Or truth[/i].”

		You raise an eyebrow. “Blasphemy before breakfast?”

		“Depends who’s calling it that,” ${sol_pron} says. “[i]The Light[/i] burns everything it doesn’t control. Poetry’s just a softer kind of heresy.”
		
		${sol_big_pron} flips the book open and reads, ${sol_pronpp} voice low:

		[i]"I loved you before the heavens knew light,
		when angels were still waiting for names.
		I loved you in the silence between heartbeats,
		and I will love you long after the stars forget theirs.”[/i]

		The words linger, [i]warm and aching[/i] in your chest.

		${sol_big_pron} exhales slowly. “They called this heresy. Said angels don’t love. That they only obey.”

		Then quieter: “I think obedience without love is just a prettier word for war.”
		
		You glance at ${sol_pronp}. The morning light catches the edge of ${sol_pronpp} jaw, the lines of ${sol_pronpp} throat. 
		There’s something fierce and unguarded in the way ${sol_pron} looks at you now. Like a prayer said too many times to be polite.

		Sol turns the book toward you. Another verse waits on the page, the ink faded:

		[i]"She moved like dusk, soft and breaking,
		her mouth full of truths too sweet to swallow.
		They told me angels never weep,
		but then I met her, and she did—
		for everyone but herself.”[/i]

		You say nothing. You can’t. Not yet.

		*page_break So Sol does it for you

		"You know the Light, don’t you?" ${sol_pron} says, voice dipped in something darker now. 
		“Steel masks. Scarlet glass. Sermons that feel more like sentences than salvation.”

		${sol_big_pron} looks out over the grass, fingers tightening slightly on the book.

		"The Light doesn’t ask you to join. It asks you to surrender. Burn the doubt. Carve obedience into your bones. 
		Pretend holiness isn’t just another name for fear."

		[i]A pause.[/i]

		“My family… they burned a witches when I was a child.” ${sol_big_pronpp} voice is very soft now. “One of them... She was kind. 
		Taught me names for herbs before The Light taught me names for sin. They said her words were poison. That she spoke temptation.”

		${sol_big_pronpp} gaze drops to your hands. “But hers were the first hands that ever held mine like they meant to keep me.”

		You don’t know what to say.

		Sol closes the book gently. “They say angels fall when they feel too much. That love [i]undoes[/i] them.”

		${sol_big_pron} meets your eyes, and for a moment, the whole world pauses.

		“Maybe that’s why I keep calling you mine.”

		You feel the heat rise in your throat. Your pulse, soft and insistent, answers for you.

		Neither of you says anything for a while. The wind brushes the field. The sun stretches higher. 
		And the book—full of forbidden verses and sacred defiance—rests between you.

		Not all prayers are spoken.

		[i]Not all angels fly away.[/i]

		The wind moves through the grass like a second breath. A quiet knowing passes between you.

		"Thank you for listening," ${sol_pron} says, voice low again. "Some things need to be said before they burn a hole through you."

		You stay beside ${sol_pronp} until the sun climbs higher. 
		The book remains closed in ${sol_pronpp} lap. But ${sol_pronpp} heart, maybe, is a little more open.

	*disable_reuse #Explore Ashwood
		Sometimes, you need a quiet morning to yourself. No one pulling you into trouble. No half-laughed questions. 
		Just your feet and the road and the slow unravelling of thought.

		You start with the path behind the bakery, where the scent of cinnamon and smoke always lingers. 
		The dew is still clinging to the grass, glittering like stars caught in the earth. Birds chatter in the hedges, gossiping like old women.

		The village is a slow heartbeat, steady and familiar. You pass the old willow tree where you once scraped your knees falling from a swing. 
		The faded paint still clings to its bark, and the rope still sways in the breeze.

		Every corner holds a memory. A scar. A story.

		The path leads you past the stream where children float leaves like tiny boats. 
		You pause at the water's edge, crouch, and watch the current dance. Your reflection stares back, older than it should be.

		You think about dreams. About voices. About the weight you carry that no one else sees.

		And for a moment, you speak to yourself aloud:

		[i]"Who am I becoming?"[/i]

		The wind doesn't answer.

		But still, you rise.

		You walk until your breath evens, until your thoughts are quieter. 
		And when you return to the village square, the sun is warmer, and the shadows less sharp.

	#Visit Lysandra
		The apothecary's cottage sits just beyond the herb garden, wrapped in vines and sunlight. 
		The door is open, as always. It smells of lavender and sage, and something faintly sweet beneath it all. 
		Comfort. [i]Safety[/i]. Home, even if it's not yours.

		Lysandra turns when you step inside, her expression softening instantly. "There you are," she says. No question. No surprise. [i]Just warmth[/i].
		
		She’s warmth wrapped in skin, soft smiles and patient hands. She listens. She sees. When you speak, she hears what you don’t say.
		
		There’s a quiet beauty to her, the kind that doesn’t shout. 
		Her skin is sun-kissed from time in the garden, scattered with faint freckles like pressed wildflowers. 
		Her dark curls are always a little unruly—half tied back with a bit of twine, like she meant to be proper and then forgot halfway through. 
		She smells faintly of herbs and honey, and her clothes are simple: 
		soft linen in earthen tones, sleeves rolled to her elbows, a faint smudge of ash at her wrist where she’s been grinding something medicinal.

		Her eyes are what undo you—steady, amber-brown, touched with gold near the center. 
		They’re the kind of eyes that look at you like you’re not a problem to solve, but a story worth hearing.

		Though she was born in another village, she chose Ashwood as her home—and the people here trust her in the quiet way that matters. 
		She tends to more than wounds. She mends grief, eases fear, and offers hope with a touch so gentle it almost doesn't feel like healing at all.

		She doesn’t demand your secrets, but somehow, you find yourself offering them anyway. With Lysandra, it’s easy to be open. Easy to breathe.

		She's packing a satchel with supplies: bandages, tinctures, dried herbs sealed in little jars. 
		Her fingers move with gentle precision, but she pauses when she sees your face.

		"Bad night?"

		You nod.

		"Sit. I have tea."

		And you do. Because it’s impossible to say [i]no[/i] to Lysandra, not because she asks it, but because some part of you wants to say yes.

		As the tea steeps, you talk. Not about the dream — not yet. But about everything around it. The village. The others. 
		The strange feeling of being a little too full of things you can’t name.

		Lysandra listens. Really listens. She doesn’t interrupt. She doesn’t fix. She simply makes space.

		"You’re changing," she says at one point, as if it’s not a terrible thing. "That’s all right. Change means you’re still becoming."

		When she presses a warm cloth to your hands to help with the shaking you didn’t realize was there, you almost cry.

		"You don't have to hold it all alone."

		She doesn’t ask what you’re carrying.

		But if you offered it, she’d take it gently.

		Before you leave, she places a small vial in your hand. 
		"For the road ahead. It’s not labelled because what you need will change. But I trust you’ll know when to open it."

		You step into the sun again, a little steadier. A little more whole.

		Lysandra doesn’t give you answers. But somehow, she helps you live with the questions.

You leave Lysandra’s cottage with her words still echoing softly in your mind. 
The warmth of tea lingers on your tongue, and for a moment, the world feels quiet—almost kind.

Then the stillness breaks.

Hooves strike the dirt road ahead. Leather and steel clatter in rhythm. You hear it before you see it—an envoy approaching from the southern path. 
The rustle of metal and banners. The crack of boots in formation, their presence slicing the morning in two.

The colors are unmistakable.

Crimson and bone. 

The Church.

[i]The Light of Valtessa[/i].

Your breath catches.

They ride through Ashwood like a blade cutting clean through cloth. Six wear the crimson and bone of the Church—the Light of Valtessa. 
Towering, masked, unflinching. Their armor gleams, but it’s the masks that freeze you. Blank bone. No faces. [i]No mercy[/i].

The other four are marked by the Crown: royal sigils, leaner builds, no masks—only worn leather and weapons that have seen real use. 
Their leather is worn but sturdy, their movements cautious, as if balancing between loyalty and restraint. Their presence is quieter. Watching. Measuring.

No one speaks.

A hush falls over Ashwood.

A child drops a wooden toy. No one moves to pick it up.

The Church dismounts first, moving with brutal grace. 
One unrolls a scroll while another slams a hammer into a post, nailing parchment to wood like sealing a coffin.

[b]“By command of the Sanctified Flame, the Light of Valtessa declares this region under investigation for signs of heresy. 
Witches walk among you. Unnatural rites have left their stain.
Any who aid impurity shall be judged as impure. Any who shelter sin shall burn alongside it.
In the name of Valtessa—the impure shall fall.” [/b]

Your spine locks. The words feel familiar. Too familiar. A weight presses down, heavy and suffocating.

They’re not just threats. They’re prophecy dressed in law.
*page_break Next

The crowd shifts uneasily, whispers threading through the air like fragile smoke. Fear curls in every glance exchanged beneath the weight of that proclamation.

Among the four soldiers marked by the Crown, one stands slightly apart—a figure carved from shadow and silence. 
${elden_big_pronpp} eyes scan the square with a calm sharpness that unsettles you, as if ${elden_pron}’s seeing everything and nothing all at once.

${elden_big_pron} moves with a quiet certainty, not demanding attention but impossible to ignore.

Your gaze lingers on ${elden_pronp} longer than you intend.

There’s something in the way ${elden_pron} carries ${elden_him}—a steadiness, like a rock braced against the storm—but also a guarded sorrow, 
buried deep behind watchful eyes.

${elden_big_pron} looks like someone carved from the edge of a storm — tall as a mountain, broad-shouldered, 
with a quiet tension in ${elden_pronpp} frame like a bow drawn but never loosed.
${elden_big_pron}’s not beautiful in the way poets write about. ${elden_big_pron}’s beautiful in the way old wounds are—something raw made permanent.
There’s a stillness to ${elden_pronp} that draws the eye—not loud, not proud, but anchored.

${elden_big_pronpp} features are sharp, clean—high cheekbones, a straight nose, lips that rarely smile but never sneer.
${elden_big_pronpp} face holds the kind of quiet that demands stillness from the world around it. A clean jaw dusted with stubble. 
A scar cuts through ${elden_pronpp} cheekbone—deliberate, old, and deep enough to suggest a blade meant to kill. [i]It didn’t.[/i]

*page_break But it changed something

One eye is a pale, unreadable grey. The other—faint green, sharp as broken glass. Not unnatural. Not glowing.
Just wrong enough to make you wonder what ${elden_pron} sees that others don’t.
${elden_big_pronpp} gaze is unreadable but steady, like the sea before it turns violent.

${elden_big_pronpp} hair is dark, almost black, the kind that curls slightly when wet, 
and there’s a streak of silver at ${elden_pronpp} temple—not age, just something ${elden_pron}’s carried too long.
Strands fall loose when ${elden_pron} moves.

${elden_big_pronpp} hands are large, calloused, the kind that have built as often as they’ve broken.

${elden_big_pron} wears ${elden_pronpp} armor like a second skin—well-worn, patched, unpolished. 
A soldier who’s stopped caring about shine and started caring about survival.
Something glints beneath ${elden_pronpp} leather. A charm, maybe. Or a broken pendant.

Birds don’t sing when ${elden_pron}’s near. They don’t flee, either. They simply go silent.

Children stare at ${elden_pronp} like they’ve seen ${elden_pronp} in a dream.

${elden_big_pron} doesn’t speak at first. But when ${elden_pron} does, ${elden_pronpp} voice is low, gravel-rough—like stone dragged across old wood. 
Every word sounds like it was earned before it was spoken.

But you’ll feel it, even now.

${elden_big_pron} doesn’t look at you like a stranger. ${elden_big_pron} looks at you like a question ${elden_pron} already knows the answer to.

And somehow, that’s more dangerous.

${elden_big_pron} doesn’t speak. ${elden_big_pron} doesn’t look your way again.

But the moment hangs heavy, like a breath held just before a storm breaks.

The Church soldiers continue their grim work, nailing decrees like tombstones.

The Crown soldiers exchange glances, cautious but restrained.

The village is caught between two forces — both watching, both waiting.

And you realize, with a cold certainty, that Ashwood’s quiet days may be numbered.
*set met_elden true
*page_break Next

You don’t know ${elden_pronpp} name.
But something about ${elden_pronp} — [i]about that mismatched gaze[/i] — refuses to let go.

You try to look away, to blend into the silence the village has wrapped around itself like a shroud.
But your eyes keep finding ${elden_pronp}.

Not the masked fanatics, not the parchment still curling in the morning wind.
That ${elden_worm}.

A soldier of the Crown. Not the Church.
But the line between them feels thinner than it should be.

${elden_big_pron} doesn’t look at you again. Not directly.
Yet something settles between you—unspoken, unseen.

Then the hammer falls again—another nail driven into wood. Another warning.

And then—
a sound, quiet at first. Fractured. Fragile.

A woman begins to cry. Softly, like she’s trying not to.

Not the wailing of grief, but something smaller. Sharper.
A single, stifled sob—like a thread snapping beneath too much weight.

She stands near the well, clutching a child to her chest.
The little one can’t be more than four. He buries his face in her shoulder, silent, but his tiny fingers fist tightly in her shawl.

She tries to quiet herself. Bites her lip until it bleeds.
But the sobs keep coming—shallow, broken things. A sound made of fear that’s been waiting too long to be let out.

No one moves to comfort her. 
*page_break No one dares

Because to step forward would be to stand out.
And to stand out is to be [i]remembered[/i].

One of the Church soldiers turns their masked head slightly, just enough to notice.
Just enough to [i]mark[/i].

You feel your pulse skip. The villagers do too.

The woman pulls the child closer. Whispers something into his hair—something that might be a prayer, or a promise, or an apology.

You’ve heard that kind of crying before.
You’ve made it before.

It’s the sound of someone realizing safety is no longer a place—it’s only a delay.
A borrowed hour before the flames arrive.

And in that moment, something in you aches.
Not with fear. Not even with anger.

With recognition.

Because you know what it means to try to be small.
You know what it means to lose anyway.
*page_break Next

The wind picks up. Ashwood doesn’t breathe.

And then ${elden_pron} moves.

A step, no more. Just enough to turn ${elden_pronpp} body—just enough to place ${elden_him} subtly, deliberately, between you and the Church soldiers.

Like [i]instinct[/i].

Like [i]reflex[/i].

Like [i]a shield[/i].

${elden_big_pron} still doesn’t speak. But ${elden_pron} doesn’t need to.

That one small gesture says enough.

You’re being watched. Not by the Church. Not just by them.
By ${elden_pronp}.

You don’t know ${elden_pronpp} name.
*page_break But you will

The silence stretches.

The parchment curls in the heat, ink bleeding like dried blood. No one speaks. No one breathes too loudly.

And then—

A gesture.

One of the Church soldiers lifts a hand. The metal of their gauntlet gleams red in the morning light, and two others move with eerie synchronicity. 
Smooth. Unhurried. [i]Certain.[/i]

They walk toward the edge of the gathered crowd.

You don’t see who they’re after—not at first.
But the people shift. Like a body flinching from a blade.

A man is pulled forward. Middle-aged. Broad-shouldered, with hands like a farmer’s—scarred, honest, tired.

His name is Tomas. You remember him. He fixes shutters when storms rip through the valley. 
He once built a cradle for a child that didn’t live long enough to use it.

Now he’s being dragged toward the post, his feet scraping against the earth like he’s already halfway to the pyre.

“No—please, wait—” he gasps, but the soldiers don’t stop.
Their hands grip his arms, impersonal and exact.

A woman cries out—his wife, maybe. Someone clutches her back before she can run forward. She screams his name like it might undo what’s already happening.
*page_break Tomas struggles

Not to flee—he’s not a fool. But to speak.
“There’s been a mistake—I’ve done nothing—please—there’s nothing—”

The lead soldier doesn’t answer. They reach into their robes and pull out a small vial—glass stoppered, filled with something dark and thick as old blood.

They hold it up like evidence. Like a sentence.

You hear the word before it’s spoken.

Witchcraft.

The village doesn’t gasp. Doesn’t cry out.
[i]Ashwood knows how to stay quiet.[/i]

Tomas’s face collapses—not in guilt, but in disbelief. His mouth opens, but the words are gone. Whatever he wants to say is already too late.

The Church doesn't accuse.
It declares.

The soldiers begin to march him toward the chapel.

For [b]questioning[/b], they say.

But everyone knows what that means.

Not trial. Not truth. Just time. And fire.

You feel your stomach twist. You feel your fingers curl into fists.

And somewhere behind the bone masks and crimson robes, you feel eyes. Watching you.

Measuring.

[i]Waiting for you to flinch.[/i]

No one moves to stop them.

But you do.

Not with your body—at least, not yet.

With your breath. With your bones. With your choice.

What do you do?
*choice
	*selectable_if (willpower >= 5) #Confront the Church directly
		You step forward, cutting across the silence like a blade through frost. 
		Boots crunch over gravel, and all eyes turn. The moment your shadow breaks the symmetry of their holy formation, the air shifts.

		[b]"Let him go."[/b]

		Your voice doesn't shout. It doesn't tremble. But it carries. Gods, it carries.

		One of the masked priests lifts his head toward you. 
		The bone mask tilts just slightly, as if considering whether you are worth the breath it takes to speak. 
		The hammer-wielder pauses mid-swing. The scroll, half-nailed, flutters like dying wings.

		[i]"Who speaks for the impure?"[/i] one of them intones. The voice is muffled behind bone and steel but still rings with authority sharpened by dogma. 
		[i]"Do you claim his sin?"[/i]

		Behind them, Tomas raises his head. There's blood at his lip. His eyes widen—not in hope. In warning.

		"I claim that you have no proof. And no right to take him."

		A murmur ripples through the gathered villagers. Not support—never that. Just shock that someone dared say it aloud.

		Another Church soldier steps forward. This one taller, heavier in build. His hand rests on the hilt of a ceremonial blade. 
		His mask is older than the others, its ivory yellowed with age.

		"Heresy doesn't beg for trial. It bleeds for truth. We will find the stain, whether it clings to him, or to you."

		The wind moves. Elden shifts slightly, barely a movement, but you feel it. ${elden_big_pron} hasn't stepped in. Not yet. But ${elden_pron}'s watching.

		Tomas' wife sobs louder now, but even she does not dare cry out your name.

		You stand alone.

		*page_break And still, you don't back down
		You step forward.

		Not fast. Not loud. Just enough.

		Enough to make them pause. Enough to be noticed.

		One of the Church soldiers turns. You can’t see his eyes behind the bone-white mask, but you feel the weight of his gaze settle on you like frost.

		“Step back,” he says. Voice like rusted iron. Flat. Final.

		[i]You don’t.[/i]

		And that’s enough.

		The blow is sudden, not even cruel — just [i]mechanical[/i].

		His armored hand strikes your cheek hard enough to knock the sky sideways. You hit the dirt, breath torn from your lungs, head ringing. 
		Dust rises around you like smoke.

		No one moves.

		Not the villagers. Not the man being dragged away. Not even the child crying behind her mother’s skirts.

		Just the birds. Lifting into the air as if startled by something invisible.

		The Church soldier says nothing. Just turns back to his duty — as if you were never there at all.

		But someone does move.

		Soft steps. A whisper of skirts. The scent of lavender.

		Lysandra kneels beside you, hands already gentle at your jaw, checking for breaks, bruises, blood. Her voice is a murmur only you can hear.

		“Don’t speak,” she says. “They’ll forget you faster if you stay quiet.”

		You nod. Or maybe just tremble.

		She helps you to your feet. Her touch is steady. Reverent. As if gathering the broken pieces without drawing attention to their shape.

		As they drag the man away, Lysandra holds you upright — not shielding you, just… there. The way warmth stands between someone and the cold.

	#Try to speak to Tomas' wife
		You break from the crowd—not toward the soldiers, but toward the house. Toward her.

		Tomas' wife crumples near the doorway, hands buried in her skirts, grief folding her in half. 
		You kneel beside her, the dust of the path clinging to your knees.

		"They can't take him," you whisper.

		She doesn't look at you.

		"They already have."

		Her voice is thin, shredded raw by disbelief. Her gaze is fixed on the soldiers, on Tomas stumbling toward the square. 
		There's a bruise blooming across his jaw. His lip is split. And yet the worst wound is the silence.

		You place a hand on her arm. She flinches.

		"Do you know what they think he did?"

		She swallows. "He helped a traveler. A girl. She was sick, burned with fever. They say she had a mark. They say he... hid her."

		Her eyes finally meet yours. "He was only trying to be kind."

		Kindness is a death sentence now.

		A Church soldier glances your way. You rise slowly, nod once to the woman—there is no comfort you can offer that wouldn't sound like a lie.

		But as you turn away, she reaches for your sleeve.

		"Please. Don't let them take him alone."

	#Watch Elden's reaction
		You stay still. Let the moment pass over you like a cold wave.

		Instead, your gaze slides—past the red and bone, past Tomas' hunched form—to the one who doesn’t wear a mask.

		Elden stands apart. Not separate. Just... unaligned.

		${elden_big_pron} watches the scene with no expression. No hand on ${elden_pronpp} weapon. No barked order. 
		But you see the way ${elden_pronpp} jaw tightens when Tomas stumbles. You see how ${elden_pronpp} hand closes into a slow fist.

		${elden_big_pron} isn't indifferent.

		But ${elden_pron} isn't moving, either.

		Maybe it’s fear. Maybe it's survival. Or maybe ${elden_pron}’s waiting to see what you will do first.

		${elden_big_pronpp} eyes flick to yours. Not a challenge. Not a warning.

		Recognition.

		As if ${elden_pron}'s seen this before. As if ${elden_pron} knows how it ends. 
		As if ${elden_pron}'s wondering whether you'll walk away, or whether you'll make the same mistake ${elden_pron} once did.

		And for just a second, something flickers in ${elden_pronp}.

		A decision ${elden_pron} hasn’t made yet.

		A promise ${elden_pron} hasn’t spoken.

		[i]Not yet.[/i]

		You don’t speak. You don’t move. Not yet.

		Instead, you [i]watch.[/i]

		Six of them. All masked. All precise. But not perfect.

		One favors his right leg slightly. Old injury, perhaps. He leans into his hammer more than he should.

		Another hesitates before lifting the parchment. Not from doubt—from training. A newer recruit. Younger, maybe. 
		His armor shines brighter than the rest. [i]Untested.[/i]

		The third’s grip on his sword is too tight. Knuckles white, breath shallow. Fear hidden under zealotry.

		Only the one with the yellowed mask moves like a man who has killed too often and forgotten why. He watches everything. Especially you.

		None of them are gods.

		And none of them expect resistance. Not here.

		The villagers have taught them silence. Fear. [i]Obedience.[/i]

		But you’re not from silence.

		You watch. And you remember. Because one day soon, you will need to know which throat is softest.

	#Focus on the parchment they nailed to the wall
		You step closer to the wooden post, the nail still trembling slightly where the hammer struck.

		The parchment curls at the corners, already touched by morning damp. But the ink is fresh. Too fresh.

		You read it again.

		[b]"By command of the Sanctified Flame..."[/b]

		The words are not law. They are warning dressed as scripture. Accusation carved into public stone.

		[b]"The Light of Valtessa declares this region under investigation for signs of heresy..."[/b]

		You scan it all. Names. Symbols. The seal of the Church pressed in wax the color of dried blood.

		The decree is meant to terrify.

		But beneath it, in smaller handwriting, is a signature. One you recognize from a ruined book Lysandra once showed you.

		[b]High Flamebearer Vechiel.[/b]

		A name that doesn’t just mean danger. It means execution.

		They’re not here to question. They’re here to cleanse.

		You tear your gaze away.

		When you look back to the soldiers, they are watching you now.

		And the parchment still bleeds on the post, even if the ink has dried.

Ashwood is going to be quiet again. But it will be a different kind of quiet. The kind that comes after the first drop of blood has already hit the ground.
*page_break Next

You don’t remember walking. You move ${posture}. No one dares to stop you.

Ashwood blurs past you—faces averted, shutters drawn, breath held behind closed doors. The echo of boots still lingers in the dirt like ghosts refusing to leave.

You end up back at Lysandra’s.

The door is still open, like always. But something’s changed.

She doesn’t greet you. Doesn’t turn.

You find her bent over the table, carefully sorting herbs into cloth pouches. Her movements are deliberate. Too precise.

You speak her name.

She doesn’t answer right away.

Then, softly, without looking up:
[i]“They’ll come for me next.”[/i]

She folds a packet of dried nightroot. Ties it with trembling fingers.

“Maybe not today. But soon. You saw the masks. You heard the decree.”
*page_break She finally meets your eyes

There’s no panic there. No tears. Only something hollow and quiet, like a well that’s finally run dry.

[i]“I’d like to leave before I burn.”[/i]

The words land like stones.

She’s not asking for your help. Not yet. But it’s there—beneath her calm, beneath the quiet scraping of string against cloth. A truth wrapped in gentleness.

She hands you a bundle without explaining what’s inside.

“For your journey. If you choose to take one.”

She turns back to her work.

“I’ll be gone before dusk. I won’t say where. Don’t look for me. But we will meet again soon.”

[i]A pause.[/i]

“And if they ask…”
She smiles faintly. Not kind. Not cruel. Just tired.
“…tell them I was never here.”
*page_break Next

You don’t sit this time.

You stand in the doorway like you’re still deciding whether this is real. 
Whether the woman at the table—gentle, steady Lysandra—can really be saying she’s leaving. That she expects to burn.

"You don’t have to go," you say, even though part of you knows she does.

Lysandra doesn’t look up.

"They took Tomas." Her voice is quiet. Too quiet. "You saw how quickly it happened. How easily."

You nod. The image of his face—confused, then frightened, then gone—flickers behind your eyes.

She presses her palm flat against the table. Her hands aren’t shaking anymore.

“I’ve kept my head down for years. Given medicine to the sick. Helped with births. Buried the stillborn. And it won’t matter. It never does.”

A beat. The wind moves through the open window, stirring the dried herbs like breath.

“They don’t need proof. They need an example.”

She looks at you then.

And it hits you, hard and sudden, how young she really is. Not ageless, not ancient like stories make the wise women. Just tired. Just afraid. Just human.

“You can stay,” you say again, even softer. “Maybe they won’t—”

She shakes her head. A sharp, small motion.
*page_break “They will.”

Another pause. Then:

“They’ll smell ash in my garden and call it a ritual. They’ll see the stains on my fingers and name them curses. 
My tea, my remedies—” She laughs once, hollow. “—it’s all proof. All sin.”

You move closer without thinking.

"Lys—"

Her eyes flick up. Wet, but not crying.
"You can't save me. Not from this."

You reach the table. She doesn’t stop you.

“Then let me go with you.”

The silence hangs for a long time.

Then:

“No.”

Just that. But her voice breaks when she says it.

She reaches for your hand. Holds it like she’s memorizing the shape. The heat.

“They’ll watch you now.”

Her grip tightens. You don’t pull away. You don’t know if you can.

“I don’t care what they think.”

She smiles at that. Not tired now. Just… sad.

“But I do.”

Lysandra’s hand lingers in yours, warm and trembling. Outside, the village holds its breath.
*page_break Next

You both stand in the fading light just outside her door, the quiet settling around you like a soft cloak.

Lysandra tucks a loose strand of hair behind her ear, eyes distant.
“I wasn’t always like this,” she says softly, almost to herself. “Once, I had dreams — of a life without fear, without running.”

You nod, feeling the weight of your own hidden past pressing beneath your ribs.
“Sometimes, I think the past clings like a shadow, even when you try to outrun it.”

She smiles faintly, a fragile thing.
“Do you ever remember the small moments? Not the big losses, or the burning… but the quiet ones? 
Like the smell of rain on dry earth, or the taste of fresh bread in the morning?”

You do. Those moments feel almost like a secret now, but they keep you tethered.

“I try,” you say. “Because without them, I’d be nothing but a ghost.”

Lysandra’s gaze meets yours, steady and warm.
“Maybe that’s why we hold on. To those fragments. To keep the ghost alive.”

A silence stretches between you — comfortable, honest.

“Thank you,” you whisper.

“For what?” she asks, surprised.

“For listening. For reminding me that I’m still here.”

She reaches out, brushing your hand gently.
“Then don’t forget. No matter what comes next.”

You squeeze her hand once, then slowly step back.

The night deepens, but for a moment, the world feels less dark.

[i]Do you want to reminisce about the good old times?[/i]
*choice
	*disable_reuse #The bird
		It had been a cold morning, early spring but still bitter on the wind. 
		You’d found it just past the well—a bird, barely more than a handful of feathers and breath, one wing hanging limp, the other trembling against the dirt.

		It didn’t cry out. It just looked at you, like it had already accepted the ending.

		You brought it to Lysandra in cupped hands, heart racing like it was yours, not the bird’s, about to stop.

		She didn’t ask why. She never does.

		She took it gently, wrapped it in cloth, warmed a little oil between her fingers. 
		She said soft things—not to you, not even to the bird, just to the quiet between you.

		You both knew it wasn’t going to live. You knew from the start. But she still did everything she could. 
		As if kindness was worth it even when it wouldn't change the ending.

		It died in your hands. Small, weightless, and terribly still.

		You didn’t cry. Not then. But something in you felt smaller, like the grief had folded itself into the shape of your ribs.

		Later that night, she left a single feather on your windowsill. You never asked why. But you didn’t throw it away either.
		*goto good_old_times
	
	*disable_reuse #The winter
		It had been the kind of winter that silences even thought. Everything brittle, breath turned to fog, sky locked in pale grey.

		You were sick then. Fever, chills, a cough that felt like it scraped the inside of your lungs raw. 
		You hadn’t meant to let it get that bad—it just happened slowly, then all at once. 
		By the time Lysandra found you, your skin was cold and your voice barely a whisper.

		She didn’t ask how long it had been. Just got to work.

		Her cottage smelled like warmth—dried herbs and smoke and the faint sweetness of honeyed tea. 
		She layered blankets over you like a ritual. Pressed cold cloths to your skin. Murmured something soft in a language you didn’t recognize. 
		Maybe it wasn’t a language at all. Just comfort given shape.

		You remember the firelight dancing across the ceiling. You remember the sound of her breathing beside the bed. 
		You remember the night pressing in on the windows like it wanted to see if you’d make it through.

		You did.

		When the fever finally broke, she gave you broth and silence. And when you tried to thank her, your voice cracked, and she just shook her head.

		“You don’t owe me thanks. You owe yourself time.”

		You don’t remember falling asleep. Only waking up to a new day and a glass bottle of something bitter and bright left beside your pillow.
		*goto good_old_times
	
	*disable_reuse #The candle game
		It was a game born of boredom, of too many long nights when the power of the world dulled and sleep refused to come.

		Lysandra lit a row of candles along the windowsill — seven in all — and turned the rest of the cottage dark. Shadows stretched long. 
		The only light was soft and flickering, gold melting into dusk.

		“Pick one,” she said. “Close your eyes. Breathe in.”

		The rules were simple: guess which candle would go out next. Not by wind. Not by touch. Just instinct. Just knowing.

		You were never right.

		But that wasn’t the point.

		She called it a game of patience and listening. You suspected it was a game of learning to trust things you couldn’t see.

		By the third night of playing, she let you light them.

		By the fifth, she stopped blowing them out at all. She just watched you watch the flames — how your eyes followed the smoke, 
		how your fingers twitched like they wanted to touch heat and never flinch.

		“You always pick the brightest flame,” she said once. “Even when it’s about to die.”

		You didn’t know if it was a compliment. Or a warning.

	*disable_reuse #The burnt stew
		It was the first time you’d tried to cook something for her.

		Not as a patient. Not as someone in need. Just… [i]to give.[/i]

		The stew was supposed to be simple. Root vegetables. Bone broth. Herbs she kept in those tiny glass jars with the smudged labels. 
		You followed the steps. You stirred and timed it and even whispered a little charm under your breath like you’d seen her do.

		And still, you burned it.

		Badly.

		It clung to the pot like regret. Thick. Black. [i]Bitter-smelling.[/i]

		You were mortified.

		Lysandra came in, tilted the lid, and inhaled the ruin.

		Then she laughed — not a cruel sound, not even mocking. Just surprised and warm, like rain in dry summer.

		“You know,” she said, “that’s exactly how my first batch of tincture turned out. Nearly killed a field mouse.”

		You tried to apologize. She waved it away.

		Instead, she took the pot, scraped off what could be saved, and tossed the rest into the fire, which made the flames spit.

		“Burnt things still feed something,” she said, handing you a cup of tea instead. “You just have to know what.”
		*goto good_old_times
	
	*disable_reuse #The fever night
		You don’t remember most of it. Being ill once more.

		Just the heat — swallowing your body like drowning from the inside out. The way the world tilted, slid, came undone in colors that weren’t real.

		And her voice.

		Cutting through the haze.

		Not soothing, not soft — not at first. Urgent. Sharp. Desperate in a way she rarely let herself be.

		“Stay here. Stay with me.”

		You think you tried to answer. But your mouth wouldn’t work. Your hands were claws, twisted around the edge of the cot.

		Later, when the worst had passed, you woke to her sitting beside you, skin drawn, a bowl of water at her feet and that same cloth in her lap, worn through.

		She wasn’t praying. She wasn’t reading. She was just watching you sleep, as if daring Death to come back for what it almost took.

		When your eyes opened, she smiled — not a wide thing, but real.

		“There you are,” she said.

		And then she cried. Silently. Just a few tears.

		But it was the first time you'd seen her break.
		*goto good_old_times
	
	*disable_reuse #The night you almost left
		You were halfway down the road.

		The forest had begun to thin. 
		The last curve of Ashwood was behind you, the scent of it still clinging to your skin — pine, and smoke, and something floral you never identified.

		Your bag was light. You hadn’t packed much. Just enough to make it hurt.

		You didn’t know where you were going. Only that you had to go.

		The weight in your chest had become too much — the memories, the looks, the fear in your own reflection. 
		You thought leaving would be cleaner than breaking.

		And then you heard her voice.

		Not behind you.

		Beside you.

		Lysandra had followed. Not rushed. Not shouted. Just walked. Quiet as the sky before rain.

		She didn’t stop you. She didn’t beg.

		“There’s more to leaving than walking away,” she said. “You have to be ready for silence to answer you. Ready to hear things you thought you buried.”

		You stood there a long time. The road didn’t pull. It never had.

		You stayed.

		You never said thank you.

		She never asked you to.

*label after_lys_mem
You leave Lysandra’s cottage just as the frost begins to settle into the bones of the village. 
The sun is already losing its fight to the clouds, casting Ashwood in the kind of light that makes everything look like memory.

Your steps are quiet, but your thoughts aren’t.

They took Tomas.

His name presses against your ribs like a bruise.

No one stopped them. No one even tried.

The houses watch you pass with shuttered windows and locked doors. The children are gone from the street. Even the crows seem to keep their distance.

Your home waits where it always does—half-swallowed by ivy and silence. 
You close the door behind you and lean against it, as if it might hold the world out just a little longer.

The bundle Lysandra gave you is still tucked under your arm. You place it on the worn wood of the kitchen table, fingers lingering at the clasp.

You’re not sure why you hesitate.

You open it.

Inside, wrapped in dark cloth, is a key.

Not iron, not silver—but something older. The metal is warm to the touch, etched with runes too soft to read but too precise to be random. 
You don’t know what it opens. But you know it matters.

The air shifts behind you.

[i]“Where did you get that?”[/i]

You turn.

Your mother stands in the doorway, pale, steady, and so quiet you hadn’t heard her approach. Her eyes aren’t on you. They’re fixed on the [i]key[/i].

“Lysandra gave it to me,” you say slowly. “She said I’d know when to use it.”

Something changes in her face—not fear. Not surprise. Just resignation, like a weight she’s held too long and can no longer pretend isn’t real.

She exhales. Not softly. Not gently. Like she’s letting go of years.

“Then it’s time.”

She crosses the room, pulls out a chair, and sits. Not the way people sit to rest. The way they sit to confess.

“There are things I haven’t told you,” she says. “Because I thought—maybe, just maybe—you’d never need to know. 
That if I was careful, if I stayed quiet long enough, the storm would pass.”

She looks up at you.

[i]“But the storm is here. And it knows your name.”[/i]
*page_break The End... For Now...

[i]That’s all for now.[/i]

The story pauses here, but only for a breath. I'm already deep in the next chapter—unraveling secrets, shaping choices, 
and pulling threads that will take you further into Ashwood and everything it hides.

If something lingered with you—whether a moment, a line, or just the feel of the forest under your skin—I’d love to hear it. 
Your feedback means the world and helps shape where the path leads next!

Thank you for playing.
Thank you for reading.
And thank you for walking with me into the dark.

Until soon.
