[b]Prologue[/b]

Run! [i]Run[/i]! [b]RUN[/b]!!

That was the only coherent thought pulsing through your head like a drumbeat, loud and frantic, drowning out everything else—every sob, every aching step, 
every scream you'd left behind.

You could hear them.

The thunder of hooves pounding into the mud, the crack and snap of branches breaking beneath the weight of beasts and men, 
the savage howls of the hunting dogs hungry for your scent.

[i]They[/i] were close—closer than before. So close that you swore you could feel their breath on the back of your neck.

Your tiny feet stumbled over roots and slipped on slick, rain-soaked leaves. Each step was agony, each breath a blade in your lungs. You were soaked to the bone, 
hair plastered to your face, legs burning.

But you kept going. You had to.

Stopping wasn’t an option.

Stopping meant death.

You didn’t know how long you’d been running. The world had blurred into dark shapes and cold rain, into panic and the deafening roar of your heartbeat. 
All you knew was that behind you were the people who wanted you dead—and in front of you, only the unknown.

*page_break Keep running...

Your body screamed for rest, for mercy, for a warm hand to pull you into safety. But all you had was terror. Cold, suffocating terror.

And then — her face.

Through the panic, through the pain, she broke through like sunlight in a storm: your mother. Her warm smile, her voice like honey and lullabies, 
the gentle way her fingers brushed the hair from your face when you cried.

You could still feel the ghost of her touch, could almost hear her whisper:

[i]"It’s going to be alright, little star. I’ll keep you safe."[/i]

And she did. She kept her promise.

She gave everything—[i]everything[/i]—to buy you this one chance to live.

You didn’t understand it then. Not really. How could a child possibly understand that kind of love? That kind of sacrifice?

But deep down, even in your fear-clouded, rain-soaked mind, you knew.

That was the last time you would ever see her.

And you ran with that grief carved into your bones.

A low branch slashed across your forehead, snapping you back to the moment. Hot blood spilled down your brow, mixing with rain and tears, 
stinging your eyes. You wiped it away with trembling fingers.

You pressed yourself against a tree, chest heaving, heart pounding.

You were alone now. No one left to carry you. No one left to hold your hand. Only you, your fear, and the bloodied legacy of a 
mother who had once called you her light, 
her [i]little star[/i].

And in that moment, you had to choose.

[i]Hide… or run.

Fight… or fall.[/i]

Because [i]they[/i] were coming.

And this night would be the night that changed [i]everything[/i].
