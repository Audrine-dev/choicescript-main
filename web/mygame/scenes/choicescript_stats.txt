You are ${name}, a soul carved by silence and shadow, caught between what you are and what you’ve yet to remember.
Your ${hair_structure} ${hair_color} hair falls ${hair_length}, clinging to you like whispers from a forgotten past.
Eyes—${eye_color}, unreadable—carry echoes of something ancient, something lost.
You stand ${height}, clothed in ${appearance}, though nothing you wear quite masks the strange stillness you carry.
A crescent-shaped birthmark marks your ${birthmark}, as though the moon itself once laid claim to you.
And in the way you move—${posture}, quiet, deliberate—there’s a sense that the world might shift when you do.

*if not(magic_awakened)
	[i]You feel... strange. Something is coming.[/i]

*if (memory_reveal)

	But each use has a cost.

*if (intention_bind)
	You have gained the passive ability to “Sense intentions” during dialogue. Truths ring louder. Lies buzz. It overwhelms in crowds but offers clarity when alone.

*if (sense_of_place)
	You now have a “Sense of Place” ability. When triggered, you can feel a hidden memory in any given natural location—leading to lore, safety, or hidden danger.

[i]Vérryn is the everyday language of witches and witchers — the one they speak among themselves in homes, woods, and hidden villages. 
It's old, adaptive, and full of warmth, memory, and survival. It is used for everything from casual talk to coded messages during witch hunts.[/i]

[i]Vér[/i] = life thread / bloodline

[i]Ryn[/i] = path / voice / current

Vérryn then means [i]The Living Path[/i] or [i]The Bloodspoken Way[/i]

It is only spoken during spellwork, rituals, sacred rites, and high magic[/i] — [b]never casually.[/b]

[i]Es[/i] = sacred / divine essence

*label familiars_diary
They are not pets. Not companions in the way the world expects. They are echoes of something deeper—shadows of memory, of truth, of grief, of the self unspoken.

When I chose—or was chosen—it did not feel like decision. It felt like remembering.

They each come from the veil’s edge. From places beneath language. From places inside me I do not yet understand. And they do not ask to be understood.

But I record what I know:

*if (ash_rat)
	[b]ASH RAT[/b]
	[i]"The one who remembers."[/i]
	Small and soot-born, with ember eyes that see into the past—not just mine. It doesn't speak, but it sings inside memory. Lullabies I never learned. 
	Places I’ve never been.
	It carries stories I have forgotten. Some of them aren't even mine.
	It chose me like dust chooses flame: inevitable.
*if (artic_fox)
	[b]ARCTIC FOX[/b]
	[i]"The silence that waits."[/i]
	So still I almost missed it. It is cold, but not cruel—only honest. It watches, endures, retreats without ever truly leaving. 
	I’ve seen it beside me in dreams, though I never heard it arrive.
	It waits. And sometimes, that is the kindest thing.
*if (coal_cat)
	[b]COALCAT[/b]
	[i]"The one who walks between."[/i]
	She sat in my lap like she owned the ruins we stood in. Smoke and shadow, with twilight in her fur. A guardian of doorways. 
	Of names. She doesn’t guard me, exactly—she guards the moment before.
	She won't protect me. She'll make sure I see it coming.
*if (murk_owl)
	[b]MURK OWL[/b]
	[i]"The witness."[/i]
	It brings silence. Not peace—silence. The kind that listens back.
	Its eyes are two wells of unspoken things. It does not guide. It questions. 
	And some nights, I dream of its wings brushing my shoulder—asking things I don't want to answer.
*if (fen_echo)
	[b]FEN ECHO[/b]
	[i]"The one who stays."[/i]
	It smells like old rivers and sorrow. It does not comfort, not like warmth—but like weight. Like knowing you're not alone in your grief.
	It never speaks. But it’s always there when the quiet gets too loud. When I falter, it doesn’t lift me—it simply stays until I can move again.
*if (gravetongue_lizard)
	[b]GRAVETONGUE LIZARD[/b]
	[i]"The mouth of endings."[/i]
	Small. Cold. Unnervingly still. It perched on me like it already knew where I’d fall. 
	It hums when I walk through death-places. Flicks its tail when someone lies.
	It listens to the dead. And sometimes, they answer.
	It will not let me forget what I carry.
*if (brindle_hare)
	[b]BRINDLE HARE[/b]
	[i]"The one who flees—but not away."[/i]
	It ran when I approached. But not far. Just enough to show me the path I didn’t know I feared.
	There’s bravery in it—quiet, instinctive. Not the kind that fights. The kind that moves. That lives. That doesn’t wait for permission.
	It reminds me that running can be holy too.

[b]Echoweaving[/b]
[i]“The past never vanishes. It sings beneath your skin.”[/i]

[i]Nature:[/i]
Echoweaving is the magic of memory, resonance, and inherited truth. Echoweavers listen to the echoes that linger in places, people, and even bloodlines. 
They don’t simply recall what was — they can pull it forward, weave it into the present, alter its thread. Time, for them, is not linear. It hums in layers.

[i]Abilities:[/i]

Reading echoes from objects or spaces (memories imprinted on matter)

Reconstructing past events in dreamlike clarity

Altering how memories are perceived or passed on

Speaking to ancestral echoes — fragments of voices long gone

[i]Cost/Drawback:[/i]
Truth becomes slippery. The more you echo, the more you risk losing your own voice. Some Echoweavers forget what memories are theirs.

[i]Aesthetic:[/]
Veins of silver light, flickering visions like threads in air, voices overlapping like whispered song.

[b]Whisperbinding[/b]
“Words have weight. Names hold power. Promises bind.”

[i]Nature:[/i]
Whisperbinding is the magic of language, names, and control. 
Whisperbinders understand that every being, every truth, has a secret name — and to speak it is to claim it. 
They can unravel enchantments, twist intentions, silence lies, or tie their voice into a person’s very breath.

[i]Abilities:[/i]

Binding creatures or people through spoken oaths

Silencing enchantments or incantations

Discerning true names or hidden meanings

Commanding, banishing, or sealing through precise language

[i]Cost/Drawback:[/i]
If a Whisperbinder breaks a vow, their voice may fracture — temporarily or permanently. Too much use, and the throat burns with the weight of stolen speech.

[i]Aesthetic:[/i]
Threads of ink suspended in the air, whispers that reshape space, sound rippling like heat.

[b]Soulrooting[/b]
“The soul is a seed. The body, the soil. What grows from it — that is your truth.”

[i]Nature:[/i]
Soulrooting is the most intimate form of magic — one that delves into life itself. 
It is the magic of connection, empathy, and inner truths. A Soulrooter touches not just the body, but the essence beneath it. 
They heal, bind, sever, or nurture from the soul outward.

[i]Abilities:[/i]

Deep healing — not just of wounds, but of traumas and spiritual scars

Entering or sharing dream-planes and internal landscapes

Severing soul-ties or curses rooted in spirit

Strengthening bonds — between people, between magic, between selves

[i]Cost/Drawback:[/i]
To root too deeply is to take on the burden of others. Soulrooters can lose themselves in someone else’s pain. If their own soul is unstable, the magic turns wild.

[i]Aesthetic:[/i]
Green-gold light beneath the skin, like veins glowing with memory. A scent of loam, blood, or rain. Dreamlike stillness when the magic moves.

[b]Bloodspell[/b]
“Power costs. Yours is written in your veins.”

[i]Nature:[/i]
Bloodspell is raw, primal, and dangerous — the magic of sacrifice, will, and unflinching truth. 
Bloodspellcasters draw power from their own life force (or another’s), shaping it into potent spells. 
It’s not evil by nature, but feared — because it does not lie.

[i]Abilities:[/i]

Ritual magic involving blood, bone, or pain

Summoning, cursing, or defending with visceral force

Bargaining with spirits or forgotten gods through sacrifice

Drawing strength from wounds or turning harm into fuel

[i]Cost/Drawback:[/i]
It always takes something. A drop of life. A piece of self. Bloodspell leaves marks — scars that may never heal, voices that linger long after.

[i]Aesthetic:[/i]
Dark crimson sigils that burn on the skin, glimmering patterns in air or ash. The smell of iron, old stone, and something older still.
