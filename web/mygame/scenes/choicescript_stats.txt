You are ${name}, a soul carved by silence and shadow, caught between what you are and what you’ve yet to remember.
Your ${hair_structure} ${hair_color} hair falls ${hair_length}, clinging to you like whispers from a forgotten past.
Eyes—${eye_color}, unreadable—carry echoes of something ancient, something lost.
You stand ${height}, clothed in ${appearance}, though nothing you wear quite masks the strange stillness you carry.
A crescent-shaped birthmark marks your ${birthmark}, as though the moon itself once laid claim to you.
And in the way you move—${posture}, quiet, deliberate—there’s a sense that the world might shift when you do.

[i]Vérryn is the everyday language of witches and witchers — the one they speak among themselves in homes, woods, and hidden villages.

[i]Vér[/i] = life thread / bloodline

[i]Ryn[/i] = path / voice / current
