You are ${name}, a soul carved by silence and shadow, caught between what you are and what you’ve yet to remember.
Your ${hair_structure} ${hair_color} hair falls ${hair_length}, clinging to you like whispers from a forgotten past.
Eyes—${eye_color}, unreadable—carry echoes of something ancient, something lost.
You stand ${height}, clothed in ${appearance}, though nothing you wear quite masks the strange stillness you carry.
A crescent-shaped birthmark marks your ${birthmark}, as though the moon itself once laid claim to you.
And in the way you move—${posture}, quiet, deliberate—there’s a sense that the world might shift when you do.

*if not(magic_awakened)
	[i]You feel... strange. Something is coming.[/i]

*if (memory_reveal)
	You now have a “Memory Thread” token. When used, it triggers a new memory fragment or rewinds a brief moment during high-stakes gameplay. 
	But each use has a cost.

*if (intention_bind)
	You have gained the passive ability to “Sense intentions” during dialogue. Truths ring louder. Lies buzz. It overwhelms in crowds but offers clarity when alone.

*if (sense_of_place)
	You now have a “Sense of Place” ability. When triggered, you can feel a hidden memory in any given natural location—leading to lore, safety, or hidden danger.

[i]Vérryn is the everyday language of witches and witchers — the one they speak among themselves in homes, woods, and hidden villages. 
It's old, adaptive, and full of warmth, memory, and survival. It is used for everything from casual talk to coded messages during witch hunts.[/i]

[i]Vér[/i] = life thread / bloodline

[i]Ryn[/i] = path / voice / current

Vérryn then means [i]The Living Path[/i] or [i]The Bloodspoken Way[/i]

[i]Es’Shael is the ritual spell-language of the witches, taught by their goddess Venora, and believed to hold power over the world’s breath and form. 
It is only spoken during spellwork, rituals, sacred rites, and high magic[/i] — [b]never casually.[/b]

[i]Es[/i] = sacred / divine essence

[i]Shael[/i] = breath / utterance / whisper

Es’Shael then means [i]The Sacred Breath[/i] or [i]The Divine Whisper[/i]

*label familiars_diary
They are not pets. Not companions in the way the world expects. They are echoes of something deeper—shadows of memory, of truth, of grief, of the self unspoken.

When I chose—or was chosen—it did not feel like decision. It felt like remembering.

They each come from the veil’s edge. From places beneath language. From places inside me I do not yet understand. And they do not ask to be understood.

But I record what I know:

*if (ash_rat)
	[b]ASH RAT[/b]
	[i]"The one who remembers."[/i]
	Small and soot-born, with ember eyes that see into the past—not just mine. It doesn't speak, but it sings inside memory. Lullabies I never learned. 
	Places I’ve never been.
	It carries stories I have forgotten. Some of them aren't even mine.
	It chose me like dust chooses flame: inevitable.
*if (artic_fox)
	[b]ARCTIC FOX[/b]
	[i]"The silence that waits."[/i]
	So still I almost missed it. It is cold, but not cruel—only honest. It watches, endures, retreats without ever truly leaving. 
	I’ve seen it beside me in dreams, though I never heard it arrive.
	It waits. And sometimes, that is the kindest thing.
*if (coal_cat)
	[b]COALCAT[/b]
	[i]"The one who walks between."[/i]
	She sat in my lap like she owned the ruins we stood in. Smoke and shadow, with twilight in her fur. A guardian of doorways. 
	Of names. She doesn’t guard me, exactly—she guards the moment before.
	She won't protect me. She'll make sure I see it coming.
*if (murk_owl)
	[b]MURK OWL[/b]
	[i]"The witness."[/i]
	It brings silence. Not peace—silence. The kind that listens back.
	Its eyes are two wells of unspoken things. It does not guide. It questions. 
	And some nights, I dream of its wings brushing my shoulder—asking things I don't want to answer.
*if (fen_echo)
	[b]FEN ECHO[/b]
	[i]"The one who stays."[/i]
	It smells like old rivers and sorrow. It does not comfort, not like warmth—but like weight. Like knowing you're not alone in your grief.
	It never speaks. But it’s always there when the quiet gets too loud. When I falter, it doesn’t lift me—it simply stays until I can move again.
*if (gravetongue_lizard)
	[b]GRAVETONGUE LIZARD[/b]
	[i]"The mouth of endings."[/i]
	Small. Cold. Unnervingly still. It perched on me like it already knew where I’d fall. 
	It hums when I walk through death-places. Flicks its tail when someone lies.
	It listens to the dead. And sometimes, they answer.
	It will not let me forget what I carry.
*if (brindle_hare)
	[b]BRINDLE HARE[/b]
	[i]"The one who flees—but not away."[/i]
	It ran when I approached. But not far. Just enough to show me the path I didn’t know I feared.
	There’s bravery in it—quiet, instinctive. Not the kind that fights. The kind that moves. That lives. That doesn’t wait for permission.
	It reminds me that running can be holy too.
