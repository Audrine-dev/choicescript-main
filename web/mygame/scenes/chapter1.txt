[b]Chapter 1 - The Dream’s End[/b]

The world shifts, the edges of the nightmare fading like smoke as you gasp for breath, the cold air sharp against your skin. 
You wake, the remnants of the dream still clinging to you, a dark fog that refuses to lift. The remnants of pain linger a deep ache that spreads through your body.
The sheets are tangled around you, damp with sweat, clinging to your skin like chains. The silence of the small, dimly lit room presses down on you. 

You don't know where you are—not anymore. The only thing that feels familiar is the cold that seeps into your bones, 
and the disorienting ache that twists your stomach. 
Your pulse races, heart still hammering from the horror of the dream. Your fingers tremble as you reach up, brushing the tangled strands of hair from your face. 
Your hair is damp, sticking to your forehead, and your skin feels clammy to the touch.
The nightmare lingers, fading slowly, but its shadows cling to the edges of your thoughts. 
You don’t know what’s real anymore. The pain. The loss. Your mother’s face is too blurry to be sure. 
A fragment. Only a ghost. Was she [i]real[/i]? Did she even [i]exist[/i]?

You shake your head, trying to push away the weight of it all. But it’s still there, pressing at the back of your mind, clawing at the fragile walls of your sanity.

Your bare feet meet the cold wooden floor, grounding you in reality for just a moment. 
The faint smell of damp earth lingers in the air—the scent of the forest that you’ve learned to live in. 
The rain outside taps softly against the window, the rhythm soothing in its own way.

You sit for a moment in the dim light, your heart still racing. You can feel the tension in your body, the tightness in your chest, 
the feeling that something is watching. 
Or maybe that’s just your mind playing tricks on you again.

Slowly, you push yourself to your feet, muscles stiff, as if your body hasn't fully woken up yet. The floor creaks beneath you, a constant reminder of your solitude. 
You take a deep breath and look down at your own reflection in the cracked mirror hanging crookedly on the wall.
Now, as your eyes meet your reflection, you’re left to wonder—[b]who are you?[/b]
